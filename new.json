{"title": "Manchester City 3-0 Young Boys: Erling Haaland scores double as Pep Guardiola's side take another step towards history", "content": "Erling Haaland is so good, he now has players asking for his shirt at half-time. The Norwegian scored twice as  Manchester City beat Young Boys 3-0  to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages - along with RB Leipzig - with two games to spare, but it was the unexpected shirt swap that had everyone talking. With City leading an out-of-their-depth Young Boys 2-0 at half-time, visiting captain Mohamed Ali Camara asked Haaland for his shirt as they left the pitch. The striker duly obliged, although appeared to say \"you cannot do this\" as he did it. \"100% not having it. That's embarrassing\" was the immediate reaction of ex-Scotland striker Ally McCoist on TNT Sports, and there was disbelief on social media at Camara's actions. But when Haaland fired in a sensational second after the break from 20 yards, McCoist added: \"To be fair, I'd be asking for his jersey after that. He's a machine.\" Young Boys coach Raphael Wicky said he was \"surprised\" and would have a \"few words\" with his skipper. Haaland's scoring exploits continue to astound. He now has 39 goals in 34 Champions League matches. Still just 23 and in only his fifth season in the competition, the Norway striker is already 20th in the all-time list of scorers. His tally since joining City is just as prolific. He has scored 67 goals in 70 games since signing from Borussia Dortmund last summer - breaking a host of records along the way. After watching Haaland score just his third goal from outside the box for City, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand told TNT: \"He is frightening. \"If he starts adding scoring from long range to his game, he is becoming impossible to mark.\" No English side has ever retained the Champions League trophy, while Nottingham Forest were the last from the country to successfully defend the European Cup back in 1980. The formidable Blues will have their sights on making more history. The comfortable win sees last season's Treble winners set a new unbeaten European record for an English side of 18 games, the fifth-longest run of any team since the Champions League era began in 1992. The last time they failed to score in a Champions League match was more than a year ago on 25 October 2022 when they were held 0-0 by Borussia Dortmund in Germany. Retaining football's top European club trophy is no easy task, with only Real Madrid having done it in the Champions League era. Only eight clubs have ever defended their title in Europe's elite competition. McCoist believes Guardiola's men could become the second since 1992. He said: \"I thought they would miss [Riyad] Mahrez. I thought they would miss [Ilkay] Gundogan, but they look as strong as ever. \"You wouldn't bet against City doing it. They are a great side, great players and have a great coach. It is so easy for them at times.\" City have made Etihad Stadium a fortress during 2023. They have won every home game during the calendar year, taking the run to 23 matches in all competitions. Sunderland hold the English record with 24 successive home wins, dating back to 1891 and 1892. Liverpool are up next at the Etihad. \"The word that defines this group of players for many years is the consistency,\" said Guardiola. \"I know how much better the competitions get, all the time.  \"We have high standards and and that is why we are still in the Premier League up there and qualified from the Champions League. People say 'yeah, the group stage, it is easy', but you have to do it. \"In life, you have to do it when people expect you to do it. Two games left. Leipzig are the toughest opponents in this group and we have to try and finish further. It is important in the last 16 to have the weapon of the second game at home rather than away.\" Ferdinand, added: \"It is a mentality thing now for Manchester City to pursue greatness. They will set new targets and not be accepting that they have won things. It can be difficult and draining mentally. They will have a manager who will set the standards. \"Real Madrid have that relationship with this tournament, the forward line at Bayern could cause anyone problems. But I don't see anyone who is the full package like Man City are. This is the only team I see as the complete team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67352638"},
{"title": "Atletico Madrid 6-0 Celtic: 'A humbling experience,' says Callum McGregor", "content": "Celtic captain Callum McGregor said it was \"embarrassing\" to lose six goals to Atletico Madrid, as manager Brendan Rodgers complained VAR is making football like a \"computer game\". A review led to Daizen Maeda's dismissal midway through the first half in a painful Champions League loss, leaving the Scottish Premiership leaders adrift at the foot of Group E. \"That's a humbling experience for us,\" McGregor told TNT after Alvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann doubles, along with goals from Samuel Lino and Saul. \"It's embarrassing to concede six goals. It's hard enough at this level with 11 men. That's two games we've had players sent off. \"If we can get to 1-0 at half-time, the game probably feels a little bit different. We make the game difficult for ourselves. \"We played really well in the game two weeks ago, but that's a sore one for us.\" Celtic were already trailing to a deflected strike from Griezmann when Maeda had a yellow card upgraded to red. The Japan forward raised his leg in a 50-50 challenge with Mario Hermoso, who caught his opponent's studs as he followed through. \"The red card is a big turning point,\" Rodgers said. \"We started with confidence, then get a man sent off early, which was a huge disappointment. \"When you watch the re-run, both players kick each other's feet.  \"The ref saw it in game time and didn't deem it worthy of anything so serious, but it just feels like a computer game now, football. So many visits to the screen, so many influences in the game. \"It's not so much the technology but how it is implemented. It's not something I enjoy.\" With one point from four outings, Celtic are not yet eliminated, although they will need to beat Lazio away and Feyenoord at home - and rely on Atletico doing them some favours. \"We knew we had to take something from this game, but with Lazio winning as well, our objective with two games to go is to get points and see if we can improve on last season's points total,\" Rodgers said. Celtic are without a win in their last 14 Champions League group stage matches (D3 L11), a run that dates back to September 2017. A last-gasp defeat at home to Lazio was hard to take, while a stirring 2-2 draw at home to Atletico earned praise. However, this was a big step backwards, even when a harsh red card and yawning gulf in budgets is taken into account. \"For Celtic, it is not good enough to lose 6-0 away from home,\" former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady told BBC Sportsound. \"Being a little bit more reserved, it might not have finished 6-0. \"But Brendan is a manager that sticks to his principles and sometimes you learn the hard way. It was very difficult to watch. \"I was surprised by the formation and the substitutions. \"In the last half an hour or so, it looked like Celtic were still trying to attack and Atletico were able to capitalise on the space that created.\" Rodgers stuck with a 4-3-2 formation after the loss of Maeda, with Oh Hyeon-gyu coming on at half-time. \"You have seen my teams enough back home,\" the manager added. \"Whenever we lose a man, it's having that structure. \"Listen, you can have any structure you want, it can be very, very difficult against that level of opponent. It just didn't work for us, so we have to take our medicine.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67352872"},

{"title": "Atletico Madrid 6-0 Celtic: Ten-man visitors suffer damaging defeat", "content": "Antoine Griezmann and Alvaro Morata both scored twice as 10-man Celtic suffered a bruising loss at Atletico Madrid to remain rooted to the bottom of Champions League Group E. Daizen Maeda was sent off after a booking was reassessed via the monitor, with the visitors trailing to Griezmann's early deflected strike. Morata added a close-range finish before the interval and thundered in the fifth after great efforts from Griezmann and Samuel Lino, while Saul scuffed in the sixth. With two games remaining, Brendan Rodgers' side are five points adrift of Feyenoord in third place. Atletico lead the way on eight points, one ahead of Lazio, who Celtic visit next. Celtic's solitary point came against the Spanish side in Glasgow a fortnight ago. That was a thrilling contest with no quarter given. This was a mundane, one-sided affair by comparison, given the visitors' miserable start, although there was much to admire in the hosts' ruthlessness and fine finishing. The game completely raced away from Celtic as Diego Simeone's team seized on their personnel advantage, which came after referee Ivan Kruzliak was asked to review the yellow card he had given Maeda for catching Mario Hermoso on the shin. The harsh red card played a massive part, but the nature of the opening goal will also frustrate Rodgers, given Celtic had started brightly. It felt both key and avoidable as Callum McGregor nodded into a dangerous area outside the box. That was compounded by it landing at the feet of Griezmann, who sent in a shot that cruelly diverted beyond Joe Hart. Celtic's response was initially strong. They held onto the ball well and Maeda, in particular, caused problems down the right. That threat came to an abrupt end when he went into a challenge with a raised boot, Hermoso went down and the Atletico players, on the pitch and on the sidelines, reacted with animated fury. Rodgers was incensed by counterpart Simone's role in the protests as the yellow card was upgraded to red. Morata's strike just before half-time ended Celtic hopes as he slid in to meet Jose-Maria Gimenez's nod across goal. The Spanish side were utterly merciless from that moment, oozing quality and scoring some exceptional goals.  Griezmann's second, an overhead kick, was brilliant giving Hart little chance. Substitute Lino more than matched that when he bent a lovely shot into the far corner.  The trend continued when Morata crashed in a swerving fifth from the edge of the penalty area and a late sixth arrived when Saul poked home.  In truth, it could have been more with both Angel Correa and Gimenez denied by the woodwork in a torrid second half for Celtic. With 11 players, Celtic might have suffered against this side. With 10 it was impossible. It all fell apart after a promising opening. Maeda's dismissal, Celtic's third in this campaign, was a hammer blow against opposition who showed incredible hunger to chase goal after goal. Rodgers was upset by the decision but will also be unhappy with some of the defending at crucial moments. That said, some of Atletico's goals were truly exceptional. Their work-rate, tactics and execution were top class as Celtic's night went from bad to worse.  A painful setback after signs of improvements at this level. : \"It's a huge gulf, you see that. These players gave everything. The sheer quality of Atletico overrides our effort. \"I feel for the players. We were undeserving of the red card, and when we get it, it's a huge challenge. \"When you see the images that the referee has seen, it wasn't representative of the actual challenge.  \"I don't want to go on about the officials. You have to accept decisions. It feels more like a computer game, the constant looking at the screens.\" : \"We started the match really well and not doing that is something that has cost us before. Then the sending off gave us calmness, more space to play in. The team has played a really good game, we need to continue like this.\" Formation    5-3-2 Formation    4-3-3 Antoine Griezmann", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67290871"},

The French forward netted the winner from Theo Hernandez's cross five minutes into the second half. Milan Skriniar had opened the scoring for PSG, heading in at the back post from a Marquinhos flick on. Rafael Leao swiftly equalised with an overhead kick from close range after Giroud's initial shot was parried. PSG are now second in the group on six points, one behind leaders Borussia Dortmund  who beat Newcastle earlier on Tuesday,  while Milan are third with five points - one more than Eddie Howe's side. Their victory means last season's semi-finalists Milan will remain in contention to reach the knockout stages when they host Dortmund on 28 November. Former goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was roundly booed by the home fans, who also threw fake money towards him, as he returned to the San Siro for the first time following his acrimonious move to PSG two years ago. Milan were much improved from their previous Champions League performances this season, with Donnarumma forced into fine saves from Hernandez and Fikayo Tomori free-kicks.

{"title": "Manchester City 3-0 Young Boys: Erling Haaland scores twice as City reach Champions League knockouts", "content": "648 Erling Haaland took his Champions League goal tally to 39 in 34 games as Manchester City cruised into the last 16 with two games to spare by barely breaking sweat against Young Boys. The Norwegian striker shrugged off the ankle injury that forced him off at half-time in Saturday's hammering of Bournemouth to clinically convert a 23rd-minute penalty after Sandro Lauper had fouled Matheus Nunes. He then smashed home a second from the edge of the area six minutes after the restart, shortly before Lauper was sent off for a second booking following a foul on Nathan Ake. In a bizarre exchange, Haaland had already handed his shirt over to Young Boys skipper Mohamed Ali Camara at the break when the Guinean asked for it as the players made their way to the tunnel. By that point Phil Foden had added a second, finding the net after ollecting Jack Grealish's superb curling pass to the side of the penalty area and skipping past Ulisses Garcia. The result sends City into the knockout phase for an impressive 11th consecutive season, and also means they have set a new record of 18 matches unbeaten in Europe for an English club. The win also extended their run of home victories in all competitions in 2023 to 23 games, one short of the English record, set by Sunderland across 1891 and 1892. Rivals Liverpool are the next visitors to this stadium, in the Premier League on 25 November. That game will almost certainly be far more competitive than this one was. As for City, they march on, knowing far greater tests lie ahead as they look to emulate their historic Treble success. On this form they will be confident enough of beating anyone. After an unscheduled early exit at the weekend, Haaland's selectionin the starting line-up was a surprise, even though Guardiola had said on the eve of the game that he would have no problem picking the Norwegian if the City medical staff declared him fit. The determination with which Haaland tore into the Young Boys defence from the first whistle was impressive. Visiting keeper Anthony Racioppi denied the 23-year-old in the opening stages when he tried to turn home a low shot from an acute angle. There was never a doubt he would score with the penalty, which he drove home with the assuredness of  aplayer oozing self-confidence. Even Guardiola celebrated his impressive second, and while the City manager subbed off his start striker soon afterwards, Haaland now needs just one more goal in any of his next 10 Champions League outings to surpass Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring 40 in just 45 appearances. Not that absolutely everything went right for Haaland, though. When skipper Kyle Walker, only playing because Manuel Akanji was injured in the warm-up, sent a low cross to the far post, Haaland couldn't get his feet in the right position to convert was seemed a relatively simple chance. Guardiola evidently thought so as he dropped his head in disappointment. By far the most entertaining aspect of this game, from a Young Boys perspective at least, was the atmosphere created by their supporters. The fans in the lower two tiers choreographed their entrance just before kick-off, so those in the higher section came in first, all wearing what appeared to be matching yellow ponchos. Then came those in the lower tier, wearing black, to match their team's colours. Part way through the opening period, they all turned their back on the game, before taking the ponchos off and twirling them round their heads. Those on the top followed that by throwing them down on those below. The display was colourful and inventive, which is more than could be said for their team.

{"title": "Borussia Dortmund 2-0 Newcastle United: Germans complete Group F double over Eddie Howe's side", "content": "2298 Newcastle's hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League were dented as they fell to defeat against Borussia Dortmund. Niclas Fullkrug opened the scoring for the hosts midway through the first half and Julian Brandt added a second from a superb counter-attack late on as the Germans completed a Group F double over their English opponents. Newcastle's best chance fell to Joelinton just after the break, but the midfielder headed Tino Livramento's cross wide from five yards out. The Brazil international's effort was a rare clear sight at goal for Newcastle, with Edin Terzic's Dortmund side having controlled much of the first period. The hosts enjoyed the better opportunities despite a much-improved second-half display from the injury-hit visitors. \"We weren't at our best today,\" said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe. \"The intensity and quality of our normal game was missing.  \"We still had our moments and Joelinton's header is probably the key moment in the game from our perspective. He would back himself to score that if it came in again.\" The game was also subject to a short stoppage after the interval as fake golden bars and other objects were thrown onto the pitch from the 'Yellow Wall', part of a protest against Uefa's proposed Champions League reforms, with one banner reading \"You don't care about the sport - all you care about is money\". Newcastle's return to Europe's elite competition began in fine fashion with a draw away at AC Milan before they thrashed Paris St-Germain on Tyneside. However, they now face an uphill challenge to qualify for the knockout rounds, with Dortmund's double victory over Howe's men moving them three points clear of Newcastle, who travel to PSG in their penultimate group match. A defeat in Paris would leave Newcastle, now bottom of the group, unable to progress in the tournament after AC Milan's victory over the French champions later on Tuesday. Newcastle arrived at Signal Iduna Park having suffered only one defeat in two months, that coming at home against the same opposition two weeks ago. But they rarely looked capable of earning revenge, with regular starters Miguel Almiron and Anthony Gordon initially left on the bench despite the under-strength look to Howe's side. With seven senior players out injured and Sandro Tonali  serving a 10-month ban  for breaching betting rules, Newcastle became the first side since Manchester United in 1997 to name eight English players in a starting XI for a Champions League match.  But it was a night of contrasting fortunes for two of those players.  Lewis Hall, who impressed at Old Trafford in the EFL Cup last week, collected an early booking as he struggled on the left and was withdrawn at half-time, having been one of three Newcastle players that had the chance to, but failed, to prevent Dortmund's opener. Livramento, who also excelled against Manchester United a week ago, looked considerably more comfortable once he had reverted to right-back having initially been deployed in midfield. First-half headers from Joelinton and Fabian Schar both lacked the power to seriously test home goalkeeper Gregor Kobel, while Joe Willock's 20-yard attempt after the break was hit straight at the Swiss international. While Almiron and Gordon's introduction did provide more spark, Joelinton's glaring miss means that Alan Shearer remains the last player to score away from home in the competition for Newcastle. And the manner in which Brandt sealed Dortmund's success, finishing off Karim Adeyemi's sweeping pass after the home side had cleared a Newcastle free-kick, will also disappoint Howe.

Rodgers' men led twice at a raucous Celtic Park, first through Kyogo Furuhashi's fourth-minute opener, then Luis Palma's angled strike, after Antonie Griezmann converted a penalty at the second attempt. But Alvaro Morata's second-half header levelled the contest again to leave Celtic bottom of the group at the halfway stage and denied them a long-awaited home group stage win. The draw means the Scottish champions retain a chance of claiming third place and a Europa League spot after Christmas, but progression in this competition is looking increasingly unlikely. \"That was a really good performance, but we just couldn't get the win,\" Rodgers said. \"I don't think you can say they'll fly back to Spain not knowing they've had a tough game. \"They didn't create so much. Their equaliser was fantastic and shows the quality at this level. \"Our reaction in the game was superb, having the courage and the bravery to play. We showed we can compete with a top level team. We can create opportunities. We can play the game the way we want to play.\" It had seemed that Celtic's hopes would be reignited after a terrific first-half display. The noise before kick-off was off the charts, and it grew even louder when Matt O'Riley superbly combined with Kyogo, who showed great composure to send the home crowd into an early frenzy.  It was no false dawn. Celtic were more than matching their illustrious opponents.  But their good work was undone when Rodrigo De Paul released Nahuel Molina, who was caught by Greg Taylor. Griezmann took the resultant penalty, and although Joe Hart saved, the ball struck a post and fell for Griezmann to finish. How would Celtic react? Superbly.  Taylor released Daizen Maeda, whose cross evaded everyone in the middle but fell for Luis Palma, who thundered a shot back across in off an upright via a slight deflection off Mario Hermoso.  A dream result was very much on. O'Riley then had a volley beaten away by Jan Oblak as Celtic sensed the possibility of a third in a thrilling opening period. Atletico emerged a different side after the break, though, and were rewarded when substitute Marcos Llorente swung in a wonderful cross for the, until then, quiet Morata and he arrowed a header home. Diego Simeone's side showed their quality from that moment, with a tiring Celtic less of a threat and having to defend with real concentration and discipline for long spells.  Substitute Angel Correa spun superbly in the box to create space and his shot was well saved by Hart. De Paul offered Celtic hope when he caught O'Riley to earn a second yellow late on but the hosts couldn't capitalise on that advantage as they pushed forward and had to settle for a point.  Great European nights at Celtic Park have been drifting into distant history. A 10-year wait for a Champions League group stage win in Glasgow has meant a lot of suffering for supporters at the highest level. The first half of this thrilling encounter was up there with some of the most compelling in some time. That elusive win was very much on the cards come half-time in what was a display of genuine quality against top opposition. Celtic did so may things well and played at a level that showed they belong here. There will be disappointment that those levels couldn't be sustained throughout. However, over the course of the campaign, Rodgers' side have shown they are far from out of place despite only having one point to show for their efforts. \"That was a really good performance, but we just couldn't get the win. We're not used to playing at that tempo and a wee bit of fatigue kicks in. \"We were unfortunate with the penalty. I thought it was harsh and it rebounds straight to them.\" \"Atletico are resolute, they made it difficult for us. They're not a team that's going to panic going down to 10 men. All the tricks came out. \"Our first half was electric. We're getting there, just one more little push.\" \"If they go to Madrid and play near to how they played in the first half, Celtic can get a result. To sustain that over 90 minutes is the critical part at this level. \"They're competing in this group now. To stay in Europe in some form after this group would be a major achievement.\" \"Atletico stopped Celtic from creating and getting into a rhythm in the second half.  \"That's what Atletico do. They find a way to get a result. They find a way to stifle you.\" Celtic return to league action with a trip to Edinburgh to face Hibernian on Saturday (15:00 BST).

Torres opened the scoring in the 28th minute with a rebounded effort after Fermin Lopez hit the post. The ex-Manchester City forward then set up Lopez for Barca's second eight minutes later. Heorhii Sudakov scored a second-half consolation goal but the hosts held on.

He then received the ball on the turn and set up Lopez who brilliantly doubled Barca's advantage with a fine strike which went in off the post. Lopez also hit the woodwork in the second half and had a header ruled out for offside which would have restored his side's two-goal lead in the 70th minute.

{"title": "Newcastle 0-1 Borussia Dortmund: Champions League reality check for Eddie Howe's side", "content": "This was the dampest of damp nights on Tyneside, with a torrential cloudburst delivering a freezing cold shower all over Newcastle United's Champions League aspirations. The Toon Army rolled up from the city centre into St James' Park fuelled by the elation of a fine start in hazardous Group F, a draw against AC Milan in San Siro followed by a spectacular win over Paris St-Germain that represented an exhilarating homecoming after two decades away from the tournament. Emotions were in sharp contrast here on Wednesday night though, as Newcastle's players and fans trooped away at the final whistle rain-sodden, bedraggled and beaten after Borussia Dortmund gave them a lesson in the harsh realities of the Champions League. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has no need to panic after one loss - that would be ridiculous - but there is no doubt life has suddenly got a whole lot harder. The optimism that was rampant when PSG and Kylian Mbappe were sent packing in that 4-1 thrashing has been replaced by a real sense of jeopardy. The smart money would still be on PSG winning the group, despite the defeat at Newcastle, so it is a bitter setback that Newcastle lost to Dortmund, increasing the significance of their meeting in Germany on 7 November. Newcastle did not play badly against the Germans and they can look back on missed opportunities, especially when Anthony Gordon was thwarted twice by Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel in the first half. They came even closer after the break when Kobel blocked an effort from substitute Callum Wilson - a first-half replacement for the injured Alexander Isak - with the England striker then hitting the bar with a header before Gordon's shot was deflected on to the woodwork with seconds left. For all this, the Bundesliga side had opportunities of their own, especially when Nick Pope made a magnificent double save from Donyell Malen and Niclas Fullkrug in the first half when both seemed certain to score. There was always a sense that Dortmund just had a bit too much nous for Newcastle. This is a club that has been around the Champions League block many more times than Howe's side, who are rookies at this level - and it showed. The German team may not be quite operating at the rarefied level they have in the past, but in players like Mats Hummels and Marco Reus they have individuals with many miles on the clock and were a bit more streetwise than Newcastle. 'Reality check' was the phrase on many lips. Newcastle could not recapture the intensity that proved too much for PSG. The snap was not there in a game played out in a deluge for the most part. Indeed, it was the visitors who started more quickly, clearly determined to put a marker down that they would not be unnerved or cowed by a spectacular pre-match display of flags and a wall of noise inside St James' Park. They play in a special atmosphere of their own at Signal Iduna Park, and this vital victory was played out to a non-stop soundtrack of singing from the colourful travelling fans. Edin Terzic's side had threatened before the decisive moment on the stroke of half-time when Felix Nmecha - who was linked with Newcastle in the summer - steered a composed right-foot finish past Pope after fine work by Nico Schlotterbeck. Newcastle were also disrupted by an early recurrence of Isak's groin injury while an attempt to inject fresh impetus in the shape of Jacob Murphy halfway through the second half lasted only five minutes before he  went off with a shoulder injury. This was simply not Newcastle's night. Newcastle will hope they do not look back on it as a big opportunity missed, because a win here would have put them in prime position to reach the last 16 - but they were short of their best and paid the price. Sandro Tonali made a 25-minute cameo and fans will be wondering if it might be his final appearance for quite some time, with the club fearing a long ban for alleged breaches of Italian betting regulations. There was the sniff of a story and a farewell contribution when he came on to a very warm reception, but it was not to be. For all the frantic finale that almost saw Newcastle snatch a precious point, this was a night that fell flat after the fervour of the victory against PSG. It was a damp squib for the majority at St James' Park, the agony after the Champions League ecstasy of the previous game. There is, though, another chapter in this story in two weeks' time.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67223369"},
{"title": "Erling Haaland: Man City striker rediscovers European scoring touch to terrify rivals", "content": "It is an anomaly of the most successful period in Manchester City's European competition history that their main striker has had a goal drought during it. Erling Haaland had not scored in five Champions League matches, stretching back to last season, before  City's 3-1 victory at Young Boys  on a sodden Wednesday night in Bern. But with City pulled back level in Switzerland through Meschack Elia's exquisite chip, their star forward rediscovered his shooting boots. City were a force to be reckoned with in the Champions League before. With Haaland scoring again, they are positively terrifying. It is small wonder that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola feels everyone outside the club is waiting, and hoping, for the Norwegian to stop scoring. After his blistering first season at City in which he scored 52 goals in 53 games to fire the club to the Treble including a maiden Champions League title, Haaland had drawn blanks against Red Star Belgrade and RB Leipzig in City's opening Group G matches. This coincided with the absence of midfield providers Kevin de Bruyne, out injured, and Ilkay Gundogan, now at Barcelona. And in the first half in Bern Haaland looked frustrated, snatching at a one-on-one after 23 minutes and sending the ball spinning wide. In the pouring rain and on an unfamiliar artificial surface, he needed a gimme - and got it when Rodri was fouled in the box on 67 minutes. Haaland slammed home the penalty and looked more like his old self. \"It is important to have the chances, the people want him to fail,\" Guardiola told TNT Sports after the match. \"I am sorry, but this guy will score goals all his life. With the chances he is an incredible threat. \"The players need the ability to find the pass like Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan. But he is going to score until the last day he plays football.\" That penalty was Haaland's first Champions League goal in 543 minutes of action, since putting City 4-0 up on aggregate at Bayern Munich in the second leg of their quarter-final last season. It was his longest drought in the competition - yet it has not stopped his statistics looking absolutely ridiculous, particularly his scoring rate. Those stats were further boosted with four minutes of normal time remaining in Switzerland, when Haaland made the game safe through a fabulous finish from the edge of the box, shifting the ball on to his right foot and curling it into the roof of the net. He has now scored 37 goals in 33 Champions League games. At 23 years 96 days, Haaland becomes the youngest player to score that many Champions League goals, breaking the record held by Kylian Mbappe who was 199 days older. These landmarks demonstrate just how high the bar has been set for Haaland by himself. Even when he drops to human levels, it represents a notable loss in form. \"He is just like any other striker - people get on to him because of the season he had last year,\" team-mate Rico Lewis told TNT Sports. \"It is a credit to him and what he did last year.\" But thanks to Haaland, City have now won five consecutive games in the Champions League for the first time since May 2021, when they won seven games in a row. Guardiola's side are unbeaten in their past 16 Champions League matches, winning 10 and drawing six, with only Manchester United between 2007 and 2009 having a longer run without defeat among English teams in the competition.

{"title": "FA Cup: Reforms to the English football calendar could see third and fourth round replays scrapped", "content": "FA Cup third and fourth round replays and the two-legged EFL Cup semi-finals are expected to be scrapped as part of reforms to the English football calendar. The changes will also see the FA Cup fifth round restored to a weekend slot. Changes have been triggered by pressure on the domestic calendar such as the expansion of European competitions. It is not yet known when the changes could come into effect, though a new TV contract is set to commence in 2025-26. However, the domestic calendar will feel extra pressure from next season when the Champions League and Europa League first phases expand to 36 clubs. Subsequent alterations to the Uefa match calendar mean the opening phase will cover 10 midweeks rather than the current six. With Fifa's international match calendar not due to change until 2026, when the four games currently played in September and October will run across a single 16 day window, it leaves a maximum of 12 spare midweeks for domestic matches to be played if clashes with European club competitions - which Uefa frowns upon - are to be avoided. In their  'invitation to tender'  statement released on Wednesday, the Premier League confirmed five midweek rounds per season would be part of their offer to broadcasters for the four-year cycle that starts in 2025. That is one more than this season, when matches are due to be played in November, January and April, in addition to the Boxing Day slot. With spare midweeks needed for matches that have to be rearranged due to clashes with the FA Cup sixth round and semi-finals, plus the EFL Cup final - which are all played on weekends used by the Premier League - there is not enough space for the domestic calendar to remain as it is. BBC Sport understands the answer is set to come through alterations to the two cup competitions. The FA could give up third and fourth round replays in exchange for a return to a weekend date for the fifth round of the competition for the first time since 2019-20. While many observers felt the EFL Cup semi-finals had to be shrunk from their current two-legged format if the competition was to be retained, the loss of FA Cup replays for top-flight teams will be lamented by some, even though they were scrapped in 2020-21 and 2021-22 due to issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. There were six replays in both the third and fourth round of last season's competition. The FA removed fifth round replays from the schedule in 2017-18. The FA has declined to comment.  Its current broadcast deal with the BBC and ITV runs to 2025.

{"title": "What could more European football mean for planet?", "content": "More teams, more games - and more flights. Next season will see men's European club football expand further, with an additional 177 fixtures across Uefa's three major tournaments - and with that comes an increasing impact on the planet. BBC Sport research suggests the inflated fixture list could lead to teams and fans flying about two billion air miles across the 2024-25 campaign, up from 1.5 billion in 2022-23.  The projected figures for next season equate to more than 4,000 journeys to the Moon and back, and would result in the release of nearly half a million tonnes of greenhouse gases which cause global heating. But how does that tally with Uefa's pledge to cut its climate impact? And what can be done? Uefa's former head of social responsibility, Patrick Gasser, has suggested the governing body stops issuing tickets to away fans for Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League matches to help reduce its carbon footprint. Here, BBC Sport breaks down the numbers and looks at the issue of sustainability in European football. The BBC's study looked at flights for teams and away fans, calculated using a Uefa minimum allocation of 5% of stadium capacity. While some supporters will travel shorter journeys by rail, the study eliminated any journeys under 150 miles long. With the average journey almost 1,000 miles long, rail travel within the sample will likely be a very small percentage. BBC Sport asked for any detail on the number of fans travelling by train but Uefa confirmed that type of analysis was not available.  The true footprint of next year's Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons will likely be considerably higher than these projections once emissions from the local travel of a projected 18 million domestic fans is factored in. That footprint will also include stadium operating emissions and the travel of Uefa officials and media, as well as the use of less sustainable forms of air travel such as business class and private charter flights, not to mention any additional fans travelling on top of the 5% or from outside of Europe. The BBC study assumed economy class travel on scheduled airlines. Next season's European expansion comes just three years after an extra 63 matches were added with the introduction of the Conference League. Uefa also added the biennial Nations League to its international calendar in 2018 on top of the European Championship which is held every four years. The men's Euros in 2020 was  staged across 11 different European countries. David Wheeler, the Professional Footballers' Association's sustainability spokesperson, accused Uefa of a \"dereliction of duty\" over its climate impact. \"They are not leading on this - they are not separate to society. Everything they do has an impact on the environment,\" Wycombe Wanderers midfielder Wheeler said. \"The way they are behaving suggests they think they are above that. It almost gives license to clubs, or even anyone in society, that you can do what you want. \"Instead of being a positive force for good they are exacerbating the problem and pushing us towards a very serious situation with a climate emergency. \"A lot of it [the tournament expansion] seems to be greed. Those organisations and many clubs want to make as much money as possible, regardless of the harm caused.\" Uefa also has a growth strategy for women's football but Denmark midfielder Sofie Junge Pedersen says climate change must be a key focus given there are already \"questions about the relative emissions both current and historical\". \"There are no excuses for Uefa not to be very active in the green transition and live up to their goals. There is so much money in the football industry,\" Pedersen said. \"In my opinion, Uefa must spend much more of its budget on the green transition, for the sake of our planet and the people, including the ability to play football around the world. \"Players from my club and national teams whom I have told about this idea have shown huge support for this. Better to help fight climate change than to get a bit more money in your own pockets.\" A Uefa spokesperson told BBC Sport the decision to expand its European competitions followed \"an extensive consultation process\" in which they \"listened to the ideas of fans, players, coaches, national associations, clubs, and leagues\". \"The new format will help us improve the competitive balance and generate solid revenues for clubs, leagues and grassroots football across our continent,\" Uefa's statement said. No other sport sees supporters travel so regularly and in such large numbers as football - and the BBC study has focused on fan travel as the biggest single contributor to emissions, with estimates suggesting it contributes 80% or more. This fact is substantially re-enforced when much of the travel is by air.  Gasser, who worked at Uefa for 22 years, suggested European football's governing body should not require clubs to offer away fans tickets as they currently do - at a minimum 5% of capacity - or go even further and reintroduce the restrictions on travelling supporters which existed during the Covid-19 pandemic. \"It would have another benefit in terms of all the security precautions which need to be taken in host cities when teams arrive,\" he said. \"We know that travel creates the biggest carbon footprint in or around football. \"I would make an exception for the finals. I think we need to look at fundamental behaviour change and that would be a good way to start.\" Gasser said the idea had been discussed \"at the executive committee level\" but was not approved or pursued \"as far as I can see\". He accepts the move would be unpopular with some supporters, but argues the unprecedented nature of the climate crisis demands such measures. Uefa said it had no record of such a suggestion being made. \"I think if you're serious about sustainability and making our sustainable contribution to fight climate change, this would be one of the measures you should implement,\" Gasser said. \"Obviously, this will not delight supporters. But as a global society we need to start to make fundamental behaviour changes. \"One of the arguments against it would be you would lose a bit of atmosphere in the stadium.  \"But for the sake of the climate... if we look at the past summer, all the wildfires, the different disasters, it is starting to [have an] impact.  \"If the climate collapses, we are all going to suffer.\" Uefa said it would \"closely monitor the evolution of competitions and implement a comprehensive assessment approach that will consider both positive and negative impacts generated through new competitions\".   While fan flights contribute the largest total emissions to European football's footprint, the environmental impact per passenger of team travel is far greater because of the use of private charter planes. These journeys have a significantly higher footprint than regular scheduled services. BBC Sport  previously reported  on the domestic private charter flights taken by Premier League clubs and the details of 'positioning flights' - where near-empty planes are flown to convenient airports, sometimes across the UK, in order to then transport players and staff to fixtures.  We have also looked at the knockout stages of last year's Champions League to see if private charter flights and positioning flights were being used at similar levels across greater distances in European football. BBC Sport found that away teams chartered a flight in 26 of the 29 matches - one notable exception being the semi-finals between Inter Milan and AC Milan in the same city. Of those 26 flights, we found evidence of 17 positioning flights. Four of those positioning flights were more than one hour long and two were over two hours long, with one plane flying two hours 48 minutes to then transport a team for just one hour 49 minutes. How teams choose to travel is an issue for individual teams and not Uefa, but the most often cited reason for the use of private charters is fixture congestion - which is not an issue clubs have control of and will only be increased by expanding tournaments. Uefa mandates the sale of away tickets but told BBC Sport it had \"no operational control over travel of teams and ticketholders\". \"Travel data is in the hands of each of the clubs, and to our knowledge there is no tool that is looking at the aggregation and analysis of these topics,\" it added. Uefa is a signatory to the  United Nations Sport for Climate Action Framework  which requires it to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2040. For next summer's Euro 2024 in Germany, Uefa is investing 32 million euros in sustainability initiatives. This includes a 29-euro flat rate discounted ticket for the Deutsche Bahn railway system and free 36-hour local transport for ticketholders.  However, the extent to which this will cut emissions or change behaviours remains to be seen. The majority of fans will not be local and 90% of emissions will mainly be from supporters travelling to Germany from other European nations. Uefa said it encouraged fans to travel to the tournament by rail or car share.  The German government has estimated the footprint of the Euros could be 500,000 tonnes CO2e but Uefa is aiming for a 20% reduction. However, that reduction is just for the finals tournament - meaning it does not include qualifying matches which were held across the continent. The growth of club matches also means the annual men's football competitions are now far more polluting than the Euro finals.  Director of sustainability Michele Uva says Uefa has to balance a lot of issues.  \"Environmental sustainability is only one chapter of the four sustainability topics we are taking into consideration. We also have social sustainability, sporting sustainability and economic sustainability,\" he said. When asked if that meant economic sustainability - money and profit - was being put ahead of the environment, Uva responded: \"96% of the money is redistributed to the clubs. We are providing all the clubs with a Uefa carbon footprint calculator to start to understand what their carbon footprint is and pushing them to reduce their emissions in such a way. \"It is now mandatory for the clubs to have a sustainability strategy and a sustainability manager. This is not only a Uefa journey, it is a football journey.\"  There is no doubt, however, that the addition of extra games makes it harder for clubs to be sustainable. The format changes themselves are, in part, a response to the threat of the breakaway European Super League in 2021. Uva said Uefa's net-zero strategy did not apply to the travel of fans: \"The net-zero commitment is on Uefa activity. The competitions are a club activity.\"  Critics say this message seems to go against much of what we know about Uefa competitions - the presentation, rules, advertising, match day and stadium operations, as well as the sale of TV rights. Ultimately, the planet does not care whether the emissions of European football belong to Uefa or to the individual clubs.  And as football will continue to be affected by climate change and extreme weather, the majority of those impacts will be felt by football's smaller teams, lower leagues, and the grassroots players.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67159156"},

{"title": "Manchester United: Andre Onana and Harry Maguire step up in Champions League", "content": "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag often reverts back to a simple demand when asked about players who are performing at a level below that required in a theatre as grand as Old Trafford. \"They need to step up,\" the Dutchman likes to say. In the Champions League against Copenhagen, on a night when United were honouring one of their greatest players and when the manager admitted \"victory is our only option\", two of his most criticised players certainly did step up. Harry Maguire and Andre Onana have been heavily scrutinised in recent times. Maguire lost captaincy in the summer and West Ham United had a bid for him accepted. The 30-year-old opted to remain at Old Trafford but, having slipped to fifth-choice central defender - behind left-back Luke Shaw - no-one was sure why. Some uncertain moments in the first half for the England defender did nothing to suggest a revival for Maguire. Not that many people have been sure why Ten Hag paid £47m to sign Onana from Inter Milan either. The Cameroon goalkeeper's perceived strength is distribution, but against Copenhagen that was not in great evidence - with the two diagonal passes sent straight out of play in the first half. However, with 18 minutes remaining, it was Maguire who forced his way onto the end of Christian Eriksen's brilliant curling cross to the far post. And with the final action of the game, deep into added time, it was Onana who beat away Jordan Larsson's penalty to secure a first win of United's European campaign and keep their hopes of qualification for the Champions League last 16 alive. Onana does not appear to lack confidence but at times during his short United career he has blamed himself for errors that have either cost goals or put his team under pressure. His clearing kicks against Copenhagen were poor but, as Ten Hag pointed out, he produced a brilliant save to deny Lukas Lerager before securing the win by saving the penalty taken by the teenage son of former Sweden and United striker Henrik. \"He showed personality,\" said Ten Hag. \"He knows that before, given the levels of what his skills are, he didn't match his skills and he could do better.  \"I think on Saturday [against Sheffield United] it was a very good performance and today as well.  \"Don't forget that brilliant save just after half-time in the counter-attack. And also don't forget, one of his skills is he's a very good penalty saver.\" Ten Hag complained on numerous occasions last season that Maguire did not produce the form for United he has shown on England duty. Despite such a bleak backdrop, it does seem the defender is starting to change his manager's mind. He was man of the match at Bramall Lane at the weekend and now has a first goal since February 2022. Maguire is also playing on the left side of central defence, which is where he operated before Ten Hag replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager.  The Dutchman immediately moved Maguire to create space for the arrival of Lisandro Martinez, the combative Argentina defender who is sidelined following foot surgery. \"He's much more proactive in possession, passing vertically, defending on the front foot, stepping in, and is very confident in duels,\" said Ten Hag.  \"I think he's dominating in the right moment, dominating his opponents. \"And then he gets rewarded - it's a very good skill for him, his heading - I have to say a great pass from Christian as well and a very good finish.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67212545"},
{"title": "Manchester United 1-0 Copenhagen: Andre Onana penalty save secures Champions League win", "content": "1716 Andre Onana saved a penalty in added time to give Manchester United a priceless Champions League victory against Copenhagen. On an emotional night that began with a lone piper walking out playing the United anthem 'We'll Never Die' as Old Trafford  paid its respects  to Sir Bobby Charlton, United fans thought Harry Maguire's first goal since February 2022 had given them the win they craved. But with the allotted four minutes of added time played, Scott McTominay conceded a penalty by swinging a high boot dangerously near Mohamed Elyounoussi's face. But Onana, who has come in for criticism since his £47m summer move from Inter Milan, turned Jordan Larsson's effort wide with what turned out to be the very last action of the game. The victory breathed new life into a Champions League campaign that had started with successive defeats for Erik ten Hag's side. It was another night when United's overall performance would not stand up to much scrutiny but, as on Saturday, the manner of the victory was secondary to the eventual outcome given the enormous legacy of the man they were trying to honour. \"First half was not so good - a difficult game. They were well organised and it was difficult to create chances, we didn't get the right build-up so we didn't get the right tempo,\" said Erik ten Hag. \"The second half was better. First half pressing did not happen on many occasions, so second half both things were better and the build-up was better.  \"There were more switches and we created more chances. The win was justified - but it was a narrow escape.\" The two players that secured the precious win for the home side are men who have endured a torrid time recently. Maguire would have been sold in the summer had he accepted the chance to link up with David Moyes at West Ham United, while many have questioned Ten Hag's wisdom in replacing David de Gea with Onana. But when half-time substitute Christian Eriksen delivered a superb curling cross to the far post 18 minutes from time, Maguire met it perfectly, shrugging off the attentions of a defender to make sure he was in position to head home. It was a moment to savour for the 30-year-old, who lost the United captaincy in the summer and at one point seemed to be Ten Hag's fifth-choice central defender, behind even left-back Luke Shaw. The hosts should have eased their path to the final whistle with a second goal but after Alejandro Garnacho's initial effort was saved superbly by Kamil Grabara, McTominay sent the rebound inches wide of the post. Skipper Bruno Fernandes also had a shot deflected wide in a pulsating finish but it seemed United would take the points anyway. Instead, they had to rely on Onana to ensure victory was not stripped from their grasp. The charismatic Cameroon goalkeeper's save will allow United to look ahead to the return meeting in Denmark two weeks from now knowing victory will almost certainly take them into second spot behind Bayern Munich in Group A. Repeated chants of 'One Bobby Charlton' and the volume of fans who gathered at the 'Holy Trinity' statue outside Old Trafford to look at the floral tributes underlined that while most had never seen him play, they are fully aware of the former United skipper's role in creating the modern-day United. The problem at present is the current side is a shadow of what has gone before.  Ten Hag is trying to build something but there is none of the verve of the Ajax side he took to within seconds of reaching a Champions League final. The first half really was poor and towards the end of the opening period came a passage of play that summed United's effort during those 45 minutes. Having forced a throw-in in a promising position, United ended up playing the ball back to Onana as, evidently, there was no option offered going forward that invited a pass. Onana took ages deciding what to do and despite having Raphael Varane and Maguire available for a short pass, he waved them away and attempted a long diagonal which sailed straight out of play. The lack of options, poor execution and general lack of dynamism was far removed from the vibrancy of the great side Charlton played in and brought understandable boos from the home supporters at half-time. Maguire's goal and Onana's save ensured a positive result, but this was by no means a convincing performance.

{"title": "Braga stake bought by PSG owners: What does QSI purchase mean for Portugal's ambitious Champions League challengers?", "content": "Paris St-Germain's dominance of French football and push for European success has been powered by the huge financial force of Qatar Sports Investments, the state-backed vehicle which took over the club in 2011.  Though QSI's stewardship of the perennial Ligue 1 leaders has drawn plenty of attention, the group's significant stake in another Champions League competitor is less widely acknowledged. Last year QSI bought a 21.67% stake in Braga, the three-time Portuguese Cup winners who are competing with Real Madrid and Napoli for a place in the last 16 this season. Earlier this month that stake increased to 29.6% following the acquisition of stakes from several minority stakeholders in the Primera Liga side. With the PSG project having proven increasingly difficult recently - star players Lionel Messi and Neymar have departed, new manager Luis Enrique is enduring an underwhelming start to the league season, and that long-wished-for Champions League crown is still elusive - some may view the Braga project as QSI's second shot at European domination. But the truth about their intentions in Portugal is very different, according to Portuguese football experts. \"[Braga owner] Antonio Salvador said [QSI] are helping in aspects other than financial,\" Aaron Barton, creator of Portuguese football website Proxima Jornada, tells BBC Sport. \"Marketing, connections, trying to cast a wider net for scouting. [PSG president] Nasser Al-Khelaifi was at the inauguration of the sports complex Braga have opened, their new state of the art training facilities.

That is a bigger achievement than it sounds, given the long-established power structure of the Primera Liga. Of 89 Portuguese league seasons, 87 have been won by either Benfica, Porto or Sporting. Only Belenenses in 1946 and Boavista in 2001 have broken the triopoly. While Benfica and Sporting are based in the capital, Lisbon, Braga is a northern city of fewer than 200,000 people. The striking stadium, Estadio Municipal de Braga, was built into the site of a quarry for the Euro 2004 tournament and has gained notoriety for its unique two-stand design with an enormous rock wall behind one goal. According to football journalist Tom Kundert, the nature of Braga's standing as a club and city mean the idea of QSI turning them into 'the next PSG' is far-fetched. \"Of course there are the Uefa rules where you can't have a controlling interest in more than one club, so QSI can't [fully] control Braga unless they sell PSG,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"Braga being a get-out clause [for QSI] is doubtful due to the [lack of] capacity for it to be a super club. PSG are in Paris, one of the biggest cities in Europe - you can see the potential. It will never be feasible to pack in PSG and do the same plans for Braga.\" The culture of fan ownership in Portuguese football, also present barriers. \"Portuguese clubs have structures similar to Germany - it's not like England or France where you can wave your notes and become the owners,\" says Kundert. \"Portuguese clubs are member owned, they have rules, any major changes would have to be sanctioned by fans and they never would. There was recent talk of Chelsea getting involved in Sporting, but that was a non-starter. \"If I was a Braga fan now, I'd be delighted with how things are. They have a local businessman in charge, who has put in so much effort, passion and time into growing his club. To have a complete outsider come in, I can never see that for Braga unless there is a complete disaster.\" So it seems that instead of a flood of Qatari cash, Braga will continue to make their own way with the player sales and savvy investments which have seen them edge ever closer to the big three. A third-place finish last season means they have reached the Champions League group stage for just the second time in their history, following their debut in the competition in 2012-13. Despite qualifying for Europe's elite competition, there was no huge summer splurge for Braga, with their biggest expense being winger Bruma for €6.5m from Fenerbahce. The 28-year-old is the third-most expensive signing in their history. \"It is difficult for Braga,\" says Barton. \"A huge club with passionate fanbase and unique stadium, but they have always been on the periphery, which they are trying to change and force through that glass ceiling.\" \"€6.5m [for Bruma] is a lot for Braga. These are names they can only pull in if they play in Champions League. The plan isn't for them to get out the group stage - at the moment they are just happy to be there.\" Dreams of reaching the Champions League knock-outs for the first time were cooled after the draw, which pitted Braga against the champions of Italy and 14-time kings of Europe, although an unlikely win over Real Madrid on Wednesday night would reignite those hopes. But Braga are used to taking small steps to achieve their goals. In the shadow of Portugal's giants giants, they have gained a reputation as a proving ground for the best young Portuguese managers. Leonardo Jardim, Sergio Conceicao, Paulo Fonseca and Ruben Amorim have all cut their teeth in the Quarry. That strategy of developing young talent internally also extends to players, says Kundert. \"Braga have made themselves an enticing club for young players,\" he says. \"The big three hoover up the best teenage talent and there are only so many squad places. \"Those players not persisted with come to Braga. Players like Ricardo Horta, their record scorer and captain, came through the Benfica academy and was let go.

{"title": "Braga takeover by PSG owners: What does QSI purchase mean for Portugal's ambitious Champions League challengers?", "content": "Paris St-Germain's dominance of French football and push for European success has been powered by the huge financial force of Qatar Sports Investments, the state-backed vehicle which took over the club in 2011.  Though QSI's stewardship of the perennial Ligue 1 leaders has drawn plenty of attention, the group's significant stake in another Champions League competitor is less widely acknowledged. Last year, QSI bought a 21.67% stake in Braga, the three-time Portuguese Cup winners who are competing with Real Madrid and Napoli for a place in the round of 16 this season. Earlier this month that stake increased to 29.6% following the acquisition of stakes from several minority stakeholders in the Primera Liga side. With the PSG project having recently taken a turn for the sour - star names Lionel Messi and Neymar departing, an underwhelming start to the league season and that long-wished-for Champions League crown still elusive - Braga may be QSI's second shot at European domination.

The England captain converted an easy tap-in after 73 minutes to give Bayern a 2-1 lead before assisting Jamal Musiala six minutes later. In the first half, Argentine forward Mauro Icardi cancelled out Kingsley Coman's eighth-minute opener with an audacious Panenka penalty. Victory extends Bayern's winning streak in Champions League group games to 16. They maintain their lead at the top of Group A with three wins from three. In an end-to-end encounter, Bayern Munich broke the deadlock when Musiala jumped over the ball with a clever dummy to let Leroy Sane's pass roll to Coman, who fired home from the edge of the area.  Galatasaray pushed forward in search of an equaliser and were awarded a penalty when Joshua Kimmich took out Icardi with a reckless sliding tackle in the box. The striker was met with huge cheers from the home crowd at RAMS Park as he dinked his spot-kick over Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich. Icardi should have added a second for the Turkish side just before the break, but, despite finding himself unmarked, his shot was high and wide. The hosts started the second half brightly and Kane cut a frustrated figure as his team-mates struggled to pick him out. However, it did little to impact the former Tottenham striker's confidence as he attempted a daring backheel, which was deflected back into his path and resulted in a simple finish and his second Champions League goal for the German champions. He was in the thick of the action again when he pulled a pass back to the penalty spot for Musiala to run on to and slot past Fernando Muslera. A dejected Galatasaray thought they had scored deep in stoppage time but it was ruled out as Abdulkerim Bardakci was deemed to have used his arm to direct the ball goalward.

After Rodrygo's first-half opener, Bellingham found the bottom corner in the 61st-minute with a fine, curling finish. The England midfielder now has 12 goals in 15 matches for club and country this season. Alvaro Djalo pulled a goal back for Braga but Real held on in Group C. Vinicius Junior thought he had added a third late on for the visitors, but his strike was ruled out for offside. Rodrygo also had a first-half effort disallowed as Real Madrid created most of the chances at Estadio Municipal de Braga. Tempers boiled over after the full-time whistle as Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was escorted off the pitch by a couple of team-mates having been involved in an incident with some Braga players. The result means the record 14-time winners lead the group with a perfect nine points from their opening three matches, while Braga are third with three points. Carlo Ancelotti's side are three points clear of second-placed Napoli, who beat winless Union Berlin 1-0 on Tuesday.  Once again, 20-year-old Bellingham proved to be the difference for Real Madrid. The former Birmingham City midfielder, who joined Los Blancos from Borussia Dortmund this summer, was integral to the Spanish La Liga side's attacks. He almost scored just after the restart, controlling a cross with his chest and seeing his volley on the turn tipped over the bar by Braga keeper Matheus. His strike, which was placed into the far bottom corner from the edge of the box, is his third in three Champions League matches this season.

After  losing 2-1 to Lens  in their previous European outing, the Gunners came through a difficult test against the seven-time Europa League winners. Gabriel Martinelli got the visitors off and running by marking his Champions League debut with a goal, racing on to Jesus' brilliant ball and rounding the goalkeeper in first-half stoppage time. Jesus then increased Arsenal's lead early in the second half with a superb strike into the top corner. Sevilla, backed by a vocal home crowd, got back into the game when Nemanja Gudelj headed in from a set-piece. From then on, Arsenal had to withstand some pressure as the hosts tried to find an equaliser, and David Raya tipped Mariano's shot on to the crossbar, although it may not have counted because of a possible handball. Mikel Arteta's side then suffered a late blow as Jesus went off with a suspected hamstring injury, but they held firm to secure a victory that moves them top of Group B. The Gunners are back in the Champions League after a six-year absence but have a squad that is still finding its feet in the competition, with several players having never played in it until this season. That included the scorer of Arsenal's opening goal, Martinelli, but he will be thankful for Jesus' European experience, which showed in this performance. Facing a hostile atmosphere at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium, the Gunners needed their big players to step up and Jesus did just that with a superb display. A Champions League runner-up with Manchester City in 2021, Jesus' assist for the opener was a thing of beauty as he brought the ball down and then spun to beat two players with one movement, before showing great vision to send Martinelli away with a perfect pass. His goal in the second half gave the visitors the breathing space they needed as Sevilla piled on the pressure looking to rescue something from the game. With three goals in three Champions League games this season, Jesus is a crucial player in Europe for the Gunners. However, he faces a spell on the sidelines as Arteta confirmed after the match that he went off late on with a possible hamstring injury.

{"title": "Celtic v Atletico Madrid: Diego Simeone fuelled by Champions League regret", "content": "Anyone who watched Diego Simeone play football will be unsurprised to learn he doesn't care what people think of his coaching methods or the performances of his teams. Whether it was in the light blue and white of Argentina or Lazio, the dark blue and black of Inter Milan, or the red and white of his current employers, he was a winner who wasn't frightened of anyone.  Simeone witnessed the Diego Maradona story as a teenager and used it as inspiration. He would go on to surpass Maradona's cap haul, playing alongside him for their country and Sevilla during a superb playing career. As a coach, Simeone has fought criticism since taking the reins at Los Colchoneros in 2011 for the way his team has approached matches against clubs perceived to be better and more illustrious. Some of the silkiest to have played the game have stuck the boot in.  Barcelona legend Xavi - there were few silkier - claimed Simeone's tactics weren't befitting of a big club.  Pep Guardiola had to dig himself out of a hole as his Manchester City side came out on top in a tempestuous Champions League quarter-final between the clubs last season, denying having a go at Atleti's style. Even one of Simeone's own players, Joao Felix, aimed a thinly-veiled dig at his tactics when he was asked to compare playing for Portugal and for his club. The £113m signing was shipped out to Chelsea sharpish and is now on loan to Barcelona. Simeone once said: \"I don't listen to criticism or flattery. One angers you, the other weakens you.\" The former Argentina midfielder is the perfect fit for Atleti. Tough, battle-hardened, seasoned. He is the embodiment of Atletico Madrid.  While neighbours Real are the establishment club in Spain's capital and footballing royalty, Atleti are the working-class underdog. And the job Simeone has done to loosen the Real and Barcelona stranglehold on La Liga over the last decade will go down in the club's folklore. Twice under the 55-year-old, they have won the title, twice they have won the Europa League, and twice they have lifted the Super Cup.  He is Atletico's longest-serving manager and only the great Luis Aragones stands above him in the club's history, both being title winners as players there as well. Atletico's title triumph in 2014 is even more impressive when you consider it came when Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were at their pomp with an equally star-studded supporting cast behind them at Real and Barca respectively.  Diego Costa, David Villa, Diego Godin and Thibaut Courtois were central to that achievement as they upset many a footballing purist. But Simeone put their success down to hard-work and togetherness. The one thing that has eluded Simeone, so far, is the Champions League. Twice he has led Atleti to the final, twice he has lost to Real. Both hurt. In 2014, a week after Diego Godin scored at the Nou Camp in a 1-1 draw that clinched their first title in 18 years, it looked like his strike in the final in Lisbon would be enough to claim continental glory, only for Sergio Ramos to take it to extra time.  Real would go on to win 4-1, with Gareth Bale taking centre-stage.  In Milan's San Siro in 2016, a penalty shootout settled it, and again Ramos scored the Real goal as it ended 1-1 after extra time. As Simeone takes his current side to Glasgow to face Celtic, it is the Champions League where his regret will lie. Since their last appearance in the final, they have only got to the semi-finals once and, yes, it was Real who beat them on that occasion too. They didn't even get out of their group last season. You can find Atletico somewhere between Newcastle United and Napoli with the bookmakers when it comes to their chances of winning it this term, but Simeone is a man who relishes upsetting the odds. They arrive at Celtic Park in red-hot form. Winning six on the bounce, scoring 16 goals in the process since Lazio goalkeeper Ivan Provedel equalised against them on match-day one. It includes a battling victory over Feyenoord in Group E three weeks ago. Seven of those 16 goals have come from evergreen French forward Antoine Griezmann, who is every bit as important to Atletico as Simeone was. Alvaro Morata helped briefly break Scottish hearts in Euro 2024 qualifying a fortnight ago and the Spain striker will be a huge danger to Brendan Rodgers' hopes of kick-starting Celtic's Champions League campaign.  Those two will be supported by Brazilian Samuel Lino, with Angel Correa and Marcus Llorente pushing for starts as well. World Cup winner Rodrigo de Paul anchors the midfield with record appearance holder and one-club man Koke and Saul Niguez alongside him. Celtic will want to target the Atleti back-line, with Uruguay international Jose Maria Gimenez out injured and Rodgers' old Leicester City centre-back, Caglar Soyuncu, only making his comeback as a substitute on Saturday.  Former Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel has been filling in in a back three in recent weeks in front of Jan Oblak, the Slovenian who remains one of the best goalkeepers in the world. While this is probably a must-win for Celtic, Simeone will be targeting six points from this double-header against the Scottish champions as he looks to create more history at Madrid's \"mattress-makers\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67205303"},

Eddie Howe's side started their return to Europe's elite competition in impressive fashion with a draw against AC Milan in San Siro before a memorable thrashing of Paris St-Germain on Tyneside.  Newcastle, however, could not rediscover that same intensity while Dortmund belied their status as Group F's bottom side prior to the game with an impressive display and secured victory through Felix Nmecha's composed finish in first-half added time. Howe's side had their chances though, with Dortmund keeper Gregor Kobel thwarting Anthony Gordon twice and saving brilliantly from substitute Callum Wilson after the break. They also came desperately close to claiming a point in the closing stages when Wilson's header hit the bar and Gordon's shot was deflected on to the frame of the goal with seconds remaining. Dortmund kept Newcastle keeper Nick Pope busy too, particularly with an outstanding double save from Donyell Malen and Niclas Fullkrug in the first half.  The result has turned this group into a tense and tight one, with Newcastle hoping for better fortune in their next game in Dortmund next month.  Newcastle's drenched players trooped off disconsolate at the final whistle, a sharp contrast to their elation at the end of the magnificent 4-1 win against PSG in their last home Champions League game.  They did not perform badly. They simply did not meet the same standard of the night against the French side, helped by a fast start and an intensity that stunned PSG. They were also up against a streetwise Dortmund side boasting experience as well as energy.  Dortmund were far more dangerous and composed than PSG, dealing comfortably with the Tyneside atmosphere and giving their own noisy supporters plenty to cheer.  Newcastle were also disrupted by an early injury to striker Alexander Isak, although Wilson was dangerous when he came on and could easily have got on the scoresheet.  Howe will also point to cruel luck and curse the woodwork at the end, but overall Newcastle had a learning experience.  The defeat is unquestionably a setback for Newcastle, especially as they knew another win here would leave them sitting pretty in Group F and locked firmly on course for the Champions League knockout stage.  But Howe will not be panicking after one loss, and nor should he.  They now sit level on points with Borussia Dortmund but in third place in the group, which serves to increase the importance of their return match in Germany.  Newcastle have certainly made life tougher for themselves with the fixtures to come but they are right in the fight to reach the last 16, even if there will have been an immediate post-match feeling that this was a chance that got away.

{"title": "Royal Antwerp: How Belgium's oldest club went from being 'dead and buried' to the Champions League", "content": "When Royal Antwerp host their first-ever Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday evening, fans watching on television - and unaware of the Belgian club's recent history - may get a bit of a shock. While most of the Bosuilstadion has been redeveloped into one of the country's finest sporting arenas, the stand facing the TV cameras will be empty due to a Uefa edict stating it is unsafe for fans. Disagreements between Antwerp owner Paul Gheysens and Tania Mintjens, owner of the land the stadium is built on, has also slowed progress. Mintjens wants Gheysens to cede more power to the fans in the way the club is run. It demonstrates how rapid the rise of Antwerp has been - so quick that even the stadium cannot keep up. Six years ago, Royal Antwerp - the oldest professional football club in Belgium, founded in 1880 and nicknamed 'The Great Old' - were languishing in the second tier. Last season, they earned a first league championship since 1957 in the most dramatic of circumstances, thanks to a 94th-minute equaliser from former Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld in the final game,  a 2-2 draw at title rivals Genk . Antwerp finished one point clear of Genk and Union Saint-Gilloise, who missed out with a 3-1 loss to Club Brugge. \"It was unreal - there is not a word in any language to describe what it means for them,\" Belgian football journalist Jan Willem Spaans told BBC Sport. \"That Alderweireld goal, Belgium has never seen anything like that. \"I went through Antwerp the next day on the train and it was a mess - people in red and white scarves who looked like they hadn't been to bed, or were out celebrating early again. The parties continued for a week.\" It earned Antwerp passage into Europe's elite club competition for the first time. While they got a reality check with a 5-0 defeat at Barcelona in their opening Group H match, the good feeling has not worn off yet. The club was taken over in 2017 by real estate entrepreneur Gheysens, who has invested millions into Antwerp. It has allowed them to sign household names such as Alderweireld, plus another ex-Spurs player in striker Vincent Janssen. Former Belgium international Radja Nainggolan also played for the club, while they are managed by Mark van Bommel, previously a midfield destroyer for Barcelona, Bayern Munich and the Netherlands. \"Since 2017, there has been an absolute revival,\" Lennart van Walsum, president of Antwerp Supporters Club UK and lifelong fan who claims he has \"red and white blood\", tells BBC Sport. \"The Geysens woke a sleeping giant. \"They have invested in the right people at the right time. You can see that in the coaches hired, in the technical staff, the marketing, the youth teams. \"Last season was legendary, almost our most successful season in 150 years. It was an iconic goal from Alderweireld - 93 minutes and 33 seconds. That 93:33 is like a brand now for Antwerp, you see it on merchandise.\" Antwerp may be an awakening giant, but it is not a complete fairytale. As well as owing a lot to Gheysens' deep pockets, the club courted controversy by appointing Marc Overmars as sporting director in 2022. While the ex-Arsenal and Barcelona star brings great nous and connections, Overmars joined Antwerp having left his former post at Ajax in disgrace after  sending inappropriate messages to female colleagues . \"People like to portray it as a fairytale, but the chairman has invested 100m euros (£86.8m) - for Belgium an incredible amount,\" says Spaans.  \"But they have invested well. In spring 2022, they appointed Overmars. He left Ajax in not the prettiest way, but on sporting merits it has been a massive success. \"I think disappointingly little has been said or done about it [Overmars' behaviour at Ajax], maybe a couple of opinion pieces, but after a couple of days the storm died down.\" \"I cannot comment on anything at Ajax, but it is clear that for Antwerp, the opportunity to sign Overmars was a milestone,\" admits van Walsum.  Those connections led to signings which have catapulted Antwerp into the Champions League, yet the club have not splurged on major signings or spent big money. Their most expensive purchase last summer was Nigerian striker George Ilenikhena from Amiens for 6m euros (£5.2m) - half of what they got when they sold left-back Gaston Avila to Ajax. Aged 51, the Antwerp-born Van Walsum has seen the best and worst of the club's fortunes and says it is down to the character of both the club and the city. \"I don't think Antwerp is built around one particular player or star,\" he adds. \"Antwerp is a very energetic place, authentic and raw. It is a city disliked by many outside it, but embraced by those within. \"Historically, the football club embodies that - the authentic rawness, work hard and play hard, no nonsense. It's not about being sophisticated but being unfiltered. That's why Alderweireld and van Bommel are successful here.\" For van Bommel, his success at Antwerp has got the 2010 World Cup finalist's managerial career back on track after spells at PSV Eindhoven and Wolfsburg went sour. \"He had a knack of growing negative at previous clubs, he would grumble and grumble,\" says Spaans. \"He has matured out of that it seems. \"At PSV, if they would draw or lose, he would sulk. He fell out with team staff, argued with the bus driver if he was five minutes late. At Wolfsburg it was quite similar. \"When he won his first nine league games with Antwerp last season, people were wondering when they would have a blip and van Bommel would start moaning - but they never looked back.\" That success is reward for one of the loudest and most passionate fanbases in Belgium who, if they have followed Antwerp since the turn of the millennium, have witnessed relegation, 13 years in the second tier and their club nearly going extinct. \"For a few years it was bumpy, the management didn't follow modern football,\" recalls van Walsum. \"We were nearly bankrupt twice, the stadium almost fell apart. During those gloomy years, the Antwerp spirit continued to shine through. \"The Belgian second division is not like the Championship. You don't usually have more than a few hundred fans at matches, but Antwerp fans continued to turn up in their thousands at tiny stadiums. \"It is easy to be a positive supporter in the last couple of years, but plenty supported when we were almost dead and buried.\" After all that,  a 5-0 Champions League defeat  doesn't seem too bad - although Shakhtar at home is surely a must-win if they are to make anything of their maiden campaign. \"We didn't play badly in that game, but for the first 23 minutes Barca were 100% efficient,\" says van Walsum on a match where the La Liga champions were 3-0 up halfway through the first period. \"We have lost 5-0 to teams in Belgium, it happens. The future is bright, so the next game can be better.\" Spaans added: \"As soon as the draw came out, even Antwerp fans knew Barca would be a tough away day. In reality it could have been seven or eight. Now they have to get points off the others, especially Shakhtar.  \"If they can't beat Shakhtar at home, it would conclude the Champions League is a wee bit beyond them. \"But they have come a long way. Their first game back [in the Belgian top flight in 2017-18] was at home to Anderlecht - they didn't have an executive box, the away side had to get ready in a shed.  \"Now the facilities are second to none in Belgian football. Except the one stand.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66935532"},
{"title": "Lens 2-1 Arsenal: Elye Wahi in starring role as Lens come from behind to beat Gunners", "content": "733 Elye Wahi starred as French side Lens came from behind to shock Arsenal in the Champions League. Wahi's first-time finish into the bottom left corner from a Przemyslaw Frankowski cross in the 69th minute saw the home side seal a notable success. The below-par Gunners rode some early pressure from Lens before Gabriel Jesus claimed a 14th-minute opener from a through-ball from Bukayo Saka,  who went off injured with a muscular problem . Lens levelled 11 minutes later as Adrien Thomasson curled a superb finish into the far corner. As Arsenal suffered their first loss of the season on a difficult night, they were dealt another blow before Sunday's crunch Premier League meeting with Manchester City as England forward Saka went off after just 33 minutes. But Lens were worthy of a win that took them to the top of Group B on four points, with Mikel Arteta's side second on three. The hosts threatened from the start with Kevin Danso shooting just wide and Thomasson's header going close before the offside flag was raised. Jesus' finish into the bottom left corner did not dampen the spirits of the home crowd who were experiencing their first Champions League game at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis since 2002. The Brazilian striker has now been involved in 16 goals in his last 16 Champions League starts, scoring 13 and assisting three. But Lens hit back following a poor clearance from Arsenal keeper David Raya out to the left. Wahi, a summer signing from Montpellier, provided the assist, expertly controlling a long ball before laying off the pass for Thomasson to finish. Gabriel was also caught out of position when given a loose pass in the Lens half and the hosts carved an opening with a well-struck effort from Salis Abdul Samed which rippled the side-netting. The 20-year-old Wahi had the final say when he swept home the winner. In doing so, he became the youngest Frenchman to score and assist in a Champions League match since a 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe did so for Paris St-Germain in December 2018. It was a tough night for the Gunners who looked off the pace as a run of nine Champions League group stage games unbeaten was ended by a buoyant Lens. Sloppy in defence, Arsenal struggled to create clear-cut chances. Lens goalkeeper Brice Samba made a good reaction save to deny Takehiro Tomiyasu from a Gunners corner, but was not tested enough. Arsenal will look to bounce back in the Champions League when they travel to Sevilla in three weeks' time, while Lens host PSV. However, the departure of Saka will be the biggest concern when the dust settles.  He was doubtful for the 4-0 win against Bournemouth at the weekend but started before being withdrawn after 76 minutes. Saka was passed fit for this match, but went off in discomfort. Before his substitution, Saka showed his quality once more by providing the assist for Jesus' strike and become the first player to record five goals and five assists in all competitions this season for a team in Europe's big five leagues. He later emerged around the hour mark and sat on the bench with his team-mates to watch the rest of the match. But, while Arteta said he had no regrets, questions will be asked about his decision to risk Saka, especially if he is absent when champions City visit the Emirates on Sunday.

{"title": "Man Utd 2-3 Galatasaray: Wilfried Zaha enjoys dream Champions League debut against former club", "content": "If you had asked Wilfried Zaha to describe his dream return to Old Trafford, it probably would not have been far off how Tuesday's game against Manchester United played out. The former Red Devils forward was not only on the winning side as Galatasaray claimed  a memorable 3-2 victory,  but he also netted the first goal to set them on their way to a first win in this season's Champions League. But when Zaha was sought out to speak about the game afterwards, it became clear that it goes beyond even goals and wins for the 30-year-old. This was about testing himself on the biggest stage, mixing it against the best - and even revelling in the competition's pre-game theme tune. Asked on TNT Sports if this first experience of Europe's premier club competition was all he hoped it would be, he replied: \"It literally is.  \"It's not even just the game, it's the build-up. When we were driving here on the coach we were playing the Champions League music - it's a different feeling. I've finally made it here.\"There's nothing like it. It's literally playing between the best and a chance to showcase my talent between the best. \"I feel like that's where it is decided whether you're good or not, so days like today are what it's all about for me.\" In 72 cathartic minutes of game time on Tuesday, the player who left Crystal Palace for a new career in Turkey in the summer underlined the wisdom behind his decision. He also gave United a further peek at what they could have had themselves if things had perhaps worked out differently in his sole season at the club in 2013-14. His goal on Tuesday was his fourth in his past five appearances against his former club - a moment he described as \"an explosion of emotions\". With Galatasaray now second in Group A with four points from their first two games, Zaha concluded: \"What is important for me is to raise Galatasaray's name to the place it deserves - that is at the top.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67002205"},
{"title": "Man Utd 2-3 Galatasaray: Late Mauro Icardi strike seals victory for visitors", "content": "2275 Manchester United's woeful season lurched from one damaging loss to another as Galatasaray took advantage of some calamitous defending to clinch a comeback Champions League win at Old Trafford. Ten-man United led twice through young striker Rasmus Hojlund, the second a brilliant effort as the 20-year-old took advantage of Davinson Sanchez's slip to race 50 yards and beat Fernando Muslera with a deft finish. But the hosts could only hold their advantage for a combined 10 minutes, as first old-boy Wilfried Zaha, then Kerem Akturkoglu levelled. Then, after Mauro Icardi had failed to convert the penalty that followed a terrible Andre Onana mistake that led to Casemiro's red card, the Argentine made amends when he sped clear of the hosts' defence nine minutes from time and found the finish. It is the first time United have started a Champions League group stage with successive defeats, and piles the pressure on manager Erik ten Hag, whose side are bottom of the table, four points behind their visitors who are second, behind Bayern Munich. United have now lost two on the trot following Saturday's Premier League home defeat by Crystal Palace, five of their past seven games and six out of 10 in all competitions this season. This was a truly awful night for Ten Hag, who stood in the pouring rain before the final whistle hoping his side could snatch something to give them hope in a campaign that has been as bleak as the weather. \"Our start to the season has not been good enough,\" he said in his programme notes. \"Although there are reasons, we will not attempt to hide behind excuses. It is up to us now to turn our fortunes around. What happens next is up to us and nobody else.\" The early signs are not good, though Hojlund at least provides something positive to reflect on for United. Marcus Rashford created the Dane's first with a lofted cross into the six-yard box, where Hojlund beat Sanchez to thump home a header. Then, after Rashford had sprinted clear only to mess up a routine square pass that should have presented Bruno Fernandes with a tap-in, Hojlund embarked on his own run from halfway, this time with considerably more success to take his Champions League tally to three in two games. Defensively though, United were shocking from that point on. Casemiro failed to track Akturkoglu's run into the box after Sofyan Amrabat had been turned too easily by the touchline, and the Turkey forward levelled for a second time. Onana's £47m price tag came with the assurance he is good with his feet. But when the Cameroon keeper sent a pass from the edge of his six-yard box straight to Dries Mertens, his goal only survived because Casemiro fouled the Belgian and Icardi missed the penalty. There was no reprieve when Icardi won it four minutes later, and the jubilant celebrations of visiting fans scattered all over Old Trafford only made a bad night worse for United. When he reflected on his unfulfilled United career on the eve of the game, Zaha said he had emerged stronger for it. There are some who argue he had the talent to operate at a higher level than Crystal Palace, and even now could be doing better for himself than the Turkish Super Lig. Zaha's complaint about water not being immediately to hand when he approached the dugout during a break in play suggests the same attention to detail does not exist in Turkey as the Premier League. Nevertheless, Galatasaray provide Zaha with the Champions League platform he craved, and almost a decade after making his United debut on this ground, he scored his first goal in the competition. There was not much finesse about it. A long ball launched out of the visitors' half, which created the tussle on the edge of the area that Zaha was simply too strong for Diogo Dalot in. His volley bounced into the ground, but was enough to send the ball looping over Onana. Unlike in September 2020, when he scored twice in a Palace win at Old Trafford but no fans were present to see it, this time Zaha was able to milk the celebrations, although they were nothing compared with those that followed the final whistle.

The England midfielder carried the ball from 40 yards out, charged deep into Napoli's defensive third and then proceeded to weave his way through their backline before curling a shot cutely into the bottom right corner to give his side a 2-1 lead at half-time. Defender Leo Ostigard had earlier put Napoli in front in the 19th minute, reacting quickest to head in after Natan's effort came back off the crossbar, but Vinicius Jr levelled for Real when he was played through on goal by Bellingham. Napoli came out with intent in the second period and their hard work was rewarded when Piotr Zielinski equalised from the penalty spot.  Referee Clement Turpin did not initially give the penalty when Victor Osimhen's shot was blocked by Nacho Fernandez but, following a video assistant referee check, the French official was told to take another look on the pitch side monitor and he overturned his decision. Real grabbed the winner with just over 10 minutes left when Federico Valverde's thunderbolt of a shot cannoned off the crossbar and went in via the back of goalkeeper Alex Meret. The victory puts Carlo Ancelotti's side at the top of Group C with six points from their opening two games, having beaten Union Berlin 1-0 in their first outing. Napoli - who had gone 14 games unbeaten at home in the Champions League - are second and only clear of third-placed Braga on head-to-head after beating the Portuguese side 2-1 last month. Braga came from two goals down to win 3-2 at Union Berlin earlier on Tuesday. Both clubs made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League last season and, at times, showed tonight that they have enough about them to enjoy another deep run in the competition. Rudi Garcia, who replaced Luciano Spalletti as Napoli manager in the summer, would have been pleased with the way his side got going on home soil, pressing Real high up the field and forcing the Spanish giants to cheaply give away possession. They deservedly broke the deadlock from a set-piece as Chelsea loanee goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga came for the cross but ended up punching thin air. Garcia, however, will be frustrated at the way the Italian champions let that early intensity to fizzle out, allowing the visitors to force their way back into the clash. It was another enthralling chapter in the ever-exciting career of Bellingham as the former Birmingham City midfielder continues to show he is one of the world's best players. He has shown an ability to score a wide variety of goals since joining Real in the summer but Tuesday's will rank among the best he has scored in his career, gliding through Napoli's backline and showing composure to apply the finishing touch.

{"title": "Celtic v Lazio: Visitors out of sorts in Serie A yet stacked with talent", "content": "Rome is famous for many things. The Colosseum. The Pantheon. Vatican City. The Spanish Steps. The Football. Italy's beating heart and capital welcomes almost three million tourists per year. It also plays host to two passionately supported yet success-starved clubs. Lazio and Roma have long lived in the shadow of their more decorated rivals AC Milan, Internazionale and Juventus, but it's impossible to ignore them. The Derby della Capitale is still one of the most captivating fixtures in the calendar. Yet silverware is difficult to come by for both, albeit Jose Mourinho led Roma to Conference League success last year, their first European trophy. Rome's blue and white half are back in the Champions League as they prepare to visit Celtic on match day two in Group E with both looking for their first victory in this season's competition. It's a key fixture, even in the infancy of this section. One man who knows the inner sanctum of the Roman clubs is Sven-Goran Eriksson, who managed both and led Lazio to their best days. Before being seduced by the England job, Eriksson guided I Biancocelesti through a golden period around the turn of the century. In the 1990s, during which the likes of Paul Gascoigne and Beppe Signori starred for the club, it looked like they would join the behemoths from Milan and Turin in the winners' enclosure, yet it did not happen. Until Eriksson arrived that is. Taking his trusted Sampdoria lieutenant Roberto Mancini along for the ride, the Swede came agonisingly close to winning the club's second title in 1999, before losing out to Milan on the final day. The pain subsided though as he delivered their first European honour, the last edition of the Cup Winners' Cup, as they defeated Real Mallorca at Villa Park. Lazio followed that up a few months later with Super Cup success against Champions League winners Manchester United, after which Sir Alex Ferguson tipped them to finally win the Scudetto for the first time since 1974. They duly did and, as if to exorcise the ghosts of the year before, did so on the final day as rivals Juventus surprisingly lost to Perugia. They would go on to lift the Coppa Italia to win their first and, so far, only double. The likes of Juan Sebastian Veron, Alessandro Nesta, Pavel Nedved, Diego Simeone and Marcelo Salas all weighed in as the unfashionable and, at times, controversial Lazio gathered silverware. It all ended almost as quickly as it arrived, with the squad disbanded and Eriksson departing for England. Three Italian Cups is all they have to show for their efforts in the subsequent more than two decades. Current coach Maurizio Sarri, best remembered in the UK for his brief Europa League-winning tenure at Chelsea, led Lazio to their best league finish since the 2000 title as they finished distant runners-up to Napoli, who created their own history last season. However, a poor start to this campaign has left them 16th in Serie A after seven matches. After a 2-0 loss at Milan at the weekend, Sarri was not slow to criticise the state of his squad in the wake of what he deemed a poor summer window. Given the club's owner, Claudio Lotito, had declared himself happy with their transfer business, it would appear he is at odds with the man who picks those players ahead of their trip to Glasgow. So will that aid Celtic, who beat Lazio home and away in the Europa League in 2019?  Serbian midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic played in both of those games but left this summer for Al Hilal. Cover arrived with Matteo Guendozi on loan from Marseille and talented Italy under-21 Nicolo Rovella, who was borrowed from Juventus but with an option to buy. Japan international Daichi Kamada was signed from Eintracht Frankfurt. He was among the scorers in the penalty shoot-out victory over Rangers in the 2022 Europa League final.  Nicolo Casale and Alessio Romagnoli are an excellent centre-back pairing, who performed to great effect last season. Serial winner Pedro is still going at the age of 36, having crossed the Rome divide in 2021. The winger has scored once against Celtic in three Champions League victories for Barcelona, but also started when the Catalans were famously toppled in Glasgow in 2012. And then there's another old campaigner up front, skipper and Euro 2020 winner Ciro Immobile, who scored against Celtic in Rome four years ago and whose goal record for Lazio is superb - almost 200 in 300 appearances. The threats are there, but Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers will hope to capitalise on an unhappy and out of sorts side that is a pale imitation of Eriksson's history-makers.

{"title": "Jude Bellingham: 'A little Di Stefano, a little Zidane' - Real Madrid have a new hero", "content": "It is a goal already being talked about as a possible Puskas award winner. Picking the ball up 40 yards from goal, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham waltzed his way past various Napoli defenders before curling a shot into the net for a Champions League moment that will long be remembered. Real may have been 3-2 winners in Tuesday's thriller, but it was the boy from Stourbridge who stole the show once more. Just when you didn't think things could get any better for Real's 103m euro summer signing, 20-year-old England midfielder Bellingham made sure he was the talk of Europe across the newspapers, TV, radio and social media. Nine games, eight goals. Bellingham's start to life at Real - after joining from Borussia Dortmund - has been simply sensational. His arms aloft celebration is already becoming iconic among Real fans, while the Spanish media are purring in admiration. 'A little Di Stefano, a little Zidane' and 'It was like Maradona' were two of the latest headlines. \"I believe in myself, but I didn't know it would be this good,\" said Bellingham. \"I owe it to the staff and my team-mates.\" Asked about any comparison with former Argentina and Napoli great Diego Maradona, though, Bellingham was quick to downplay them. \"That's a bit too much,\" he said. \"It was a nice goal. From what I've seen on YouTube and documentaries, his quality was a bit more than mine, or a lot more. I'm just trying to contribute in a Jude way. \"It may have been one of my best goals. We were facing a great team and in a great stadium. The most important thing has been the victory and having contributed to it. It is important to continue with this pace.\" When Bellingham left Birmingham for Dortmund for £25m in 2020, becoming the most expensive 17-year-old in the history of football, the Championship side were mocked by some for retiring the teenager's shirt number, despite his only playing one full season. Who's laughing now? He has been described as a possible three-time Ballon d'Or winner by former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand and is now seen as a key man for both England and Real Madrid. Spanish football expert Guillem Balague has even described Bellingham as \"the best player in the world right now\". He said: \"His dream was always to be part of La Liga at the biggest level and he believes he belongs to that level. In Spain the comparisons have started, first Zidane, then Di Stefano. Everybody, all the players, are saying what a brilliant guy and brilliant footballer he is.\" After watching Bellingham drive Real to the top of La Liga and put them in control of their Champions League group, manager Carlo Ancelotti said: \"I'm surprised he's only 20 years old because he looks like he's 30 because of his character and attitude. \"He is always focused on the game and knows what he has to do. It's unusual for a 20-year-old. He has a lot of quality, physical strength and skill. He surprises me like he does to everyone else.\" Forget Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. Real appear to have found a new formidable partnership. Brazil forward Vinicius Jr, just back from injury, and Bellingham have struck up a friendship on and off the field that will be ominous for the rest of Europe. \"He's incredible,\" Bellingham said of 23-year-old Vinicius. \"He's probably the best in the world. \"He's one of the most talented players I've ever played with. He makes games easier for me with his speed and his ability.\" The admiration is mutual. \"I wanted Jude at Real Madrid,\" said Vinicius after the Napoli game. \"I sent many messages to Bellingham last year. I was texting every day and I was telling him: come to Madrid.\" Spanish football commentators were full of praise about Bellingham's performance. \"Bellingham reminds one of Di Stefano,\" enthused sports daily AS' top columnist Alfredo Relano, comparing the young English player to the legendary Argentine-born player who was a legend at Real Madrid in the 1960s. \"Elegant on the run and in the handling of the ball, but fierce and untiring in the fight. Half artist, half warrior,\" Relano wrote. Praising the goal scored by Bellingham, Relano said he \"slipped through the Napoli defence like a knife through butter\". Another well-known Spanish sports daily, Marca, dedicated a whole article to focus on Bellingham's habit of having his tongue out in an apparent act of concentration when he was playing. \"Jude Bellingham, the tongue of genius which the world of football needed,\" Marca's story said. Noting that other global sports stars, such as basketball ace Michael Jordan had a similar habit, Marca called Bellingham's performance against Napoli a \"repertoire of concentration\". \"And now, rivals will feel the worst is coming when Jude sticks his tongue out, and it's one that the world of football needed,\" the report added. \"Bellingham has been the signing of the summer for Real Madrid. The Englishman has become the new idol of the 'whites' [Real Madrid] with his goals and good play,\" declared daily Mundo Deportivo. \"Bellingham's doctorate in Maradona's house\" was the headline in the sports pages of major Spanish daily El Pais, referring to the display put on by Bellingham in Napoli's Diego Armando Maradona stadium. \"In Naples, in the temple of one of the greatest deities in the history of football, he ran with the ease of somebody moving through his own garden,\" the El Pais correspondent wrote, comparing him to the late Argentine icon Diego Maradona.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67005713"},
{"title": "Newcastle United 4-1 Paris St-Germain: Magpies' win worth the 20-year wait - Phil McNulty", "content": "1349 Newcastle United and the Toon Army had waited two decades for a Champions League night like this and when it came it was worth every day and all the disappointments in between after an electrifying night on Tyneside. As the Geordie hordes filed down the hill past statues of Sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer - manager and player when Barcelona won 2-0 in the last Champions League game at St James' Park in March 2003 - it almost looked like they were walking on air. When Eddie Howe arrived at Newcastle almost two years ago, the first major appointment of the club's controversial Saudi Arabian owners, they were 19th in the Premier League and five points from safety. It is the result of Howe's shrewd management and high finance that has led to a return to the Champions League and a night that saw  Paris St-Germain thrashed 4-1  in another statement about the transformation this club had undergone. PSG and their superstar Kylian Mbappe were touted as the true test of Newcastle's Champions League credentials. It was an examination Howe and his players passed with distinction. Yes, PSG were poor but to simply put Newcastle's comprehensive triumph down to their deficiencies is to do the Magpies the greatest disservice as this was their night, their control, almost from start to finish. This game provided a storyline and scoreline that Newcastle fans will talk about for years, a night to treasure for supporters who have to cast minds back to 1969 and the long-gone Inter-Cities Fairs Cup for their last major trophy. Just driving into Newcastle hours before kick-off was to see a fanbase almost in a frenzy of anticipation, thousands gathered in the roads and around the stadium barely able to wait for the game to start. As Howe walked along the perimeter of the pitch towards the tunnel before kick-off, one elderly fan festooned in club colours from head to foot leaned out towards the pensive looking manager and shouted: \"You've got this Eddie.\" It transpired that he had. St James' Park was a cauldron as PSG were greeted by four thick black and white walls of flags in each stand and banners, including a mosaic behind one goal that read: \"Hello Hello.\" It was not meant as a warm welcome off the pitch and PSG did not get one on it either. Newcastle made a fast start and barely let up. Anthony Gordon whirled his arms in a demand for greater noise - not that it was needed - in the opening seconds while Bruno Guimaraes and Dan Burn reacted to winning relatively routine challenges by turning to the crowd with fists clenched and roars. And how this packed house lapped it all up. Mbappe offered an early threat when he set up a chance for Ousmane Dembele but that was about it. Outnumbered, marginalised and shut down, Mbappe was the picture of frustration long before the final whistle. The opening phases almost felt like an emotional release for Newcastle and their followers after two decades with their noses pressed up against the Champions League window. Newcastle simply overran PSG from the moment Miguel Almiron fired them in front after only 17 minutes. And how sweet it was that two Geordie boys, the towering Burn and Sean Longstaff, provided the next two goals that put Newcastle out of sight and into the healthy position of four points from their first two Champions League group games after the draw against AC Milan in the San Siro. The potential battle between Burn and Mbappe had been flagged up before kick-off, with the suggested sub-plot that this was where PSG would probe a Newcastle weakness. In the end their paths never crossed as Mbappe patrolled the left flank, occasionally wandering in lacklustre fashion, while Burn covered himself in glory. Only one will remember this night with fondness and it will not be Mbappe. Even Lucas Hernandez's header did nothing to disturb Newcastle's momentum and this perfect night was given the perfect finish when central defender Fabian Schar drilled a 20-yard finish high past PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in stoppage time. A stunning long-range piledriver from a pillar of Newcastle's rearguard? It just about summed up the whole occasion. The final whistle was greeted by a noise that could have been heard across the Tyne Bridge.  Newcastle are only at the start of this Champions League campaign but after faltering footsteps in the San Siro, even though they earned a goalless draw, this was a performance and atmosphere that Borussia Dortmund may approach with trepidation as the next visitors to St James Park. The traditional old Newcastle watering holes on the doorstep of the stadium such as The Strawberry were in the process of being drunk dry after the game and the Toon Army will hope they have more opportunities to do the same in future Champions League games. Newcastle still have much to do in this group and their fans will know it - or at least they will once they come down from the highs and likely hangovers after this night of pure elation.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67013557"},

The fan was stabbed twice in the arm and once in the back, but is expected to leave hospital on Tuesday.

{"title": "Celtic 1-2 Lazio: Pedro scores at death to leave Scots bottom of group", "content": "Celtic endured late heartbreak as Pedro's 95th-minute winner consigned the defending Scottish champions to another Champions League defeat. Kyogo Furuhashi showed great composure to slide in his first goal in the competition to ignite a rowdy Celtic Park early on. However, indecision in the home defence was punished midway through the first half as Matias Vecino was afforded space to glance in a header. Brendan Rodgers' side thought they had snatched a late winner through Luis Palma only for the video assistant referee (VAR) to intervene, and Celtic's anguish would grow further as the Italians dramatically struck with just seconds left. With Atletico Madrid beating Feyenoord 3-2 in Spain, it means Celtic, who have now not won at home in the Champions League for 10 years, sit bottom of Group E with no points after two games before a double-header against the Spaniards. Nightmarish traffic around Glasgow's east end meant a fair few fans were not in their seats for kick-off. They missed Celtic motoring to quite a start under the Champions League lights.  Little surprise then when the home side accelerated to just the reward their early play deserved. Matt O'Riley's pass into Kyogo was perfect for the Japanese to hit the ball underneath keeper Ivan Provedel.    The Italians flattered to deceive in the game's first quarter, but they eventually awoke to peg their hosts back; Vecino's header creeping agonisingly over the line by a foot or so before Hart clawed it clear. Both sides exchanged chances before the break, but the visitors should have taken the lead five minutes after the restart. Felipe Anderson raced in on the right side of the box, only to hesitate and harmlessly prod an effort wide. The bumper home crowd were then nearly celebrating another Celtic goal. Reo Hatate's low shot from an O'Riley free-kick lay off brought a smart save from Provedel before right-back Alastair Johnston blasted over. You had the sense something was coming.  And in the 81st minute, Celtic Park thought that something had arrived. Palma's snapshot found the bottom corner with a fine finish, only for a prolonged VAR check to bring wild celebrations to a shuddering halt. While that felt bad for the home support, things would get worse in the dwindling seconds. The returning Cameron Carter-Vickers was robbed of possession, with Matteo Guendouzi's perfect cross being nodded back across Hart and into the bottom corner by Pedro. The overriding feeling here is one of frustration for Celtic.   They started like a house on fire, got the goal their early energy deserved, then fell out of things for a while to allow Lazio to level. Never outclassed, they matched the Serie A side after the break and thought they had taken three precious Champions League points for the first time in a decade when Palma blasted in.   Denied by VAR, Celtic not only failed to find a winner, they could not keep Lazio out.  More Champions League pain for Celtic, who have a difficult double-header with Atletico Madrid in store for them next in this competition. Yet to get off the mark in the group, it is a real uphill battle for them now to stay in Europe this season.

{"title": "Leipzig 1-3 Manchester City: Substitutes Julian Alvarez and Jeremy Doku help City clinch late win", "content": "874 Substitutes Julian Alvarez and Jeremy Doku scored late goals as Manchester City recovered from back-to-back defeats to beat Leipzig in the Champions League. Defending champions City, who came into the game on the back of losses to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup and Wolves in the Premier League, looked in complete control in the first half. Phil Foden gave them a deserved lead with a difficult shot on the bounce following a cutback by Rico Lewis, who impressed in a central midfield role. Leipzig scored with their only shot on target, as Lois Openda raced onto a through ball before slotting the ball past Ederson via the inside of the post. But it was all City from then with Foden hitting the post with a free-kick and Erling Haaland missing a host of chances. Five minutes after coming off the bench, Alvarez lifted a perfectly weighted shot into the top corner from the edge of the box following a pass by Doku. The Argentine then found Doku in space and he sped away to score a late third and seal the points. City have now equalled the longest European unbeaten run by an English club - level on 16 with Leeds (1967-1968), Tottenham (1967-1972), Chelsea (2018-2019) and West Ham, whose run started last year and is still going too. Pep Guardiola's side will be relieved to get back to winning ways as they prepare to visit title rivals Arsenal on Sunday. \"I will not judge my team on results,\" Guardiola told TNT Sports. \"Both games were not the best results, but it is not easy when both teams defend with 10 in the box.  \"If you think I will doubt my players, you are wrong. I rely on these guys unconditionally. We go to Arsenal, rest and hopefully in May we will arrive in the competitions being there.\" City looked unbeatable in the opening weeks of the season as they started to build on last season's Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup haul. The vibe was slightly different coming into this. Had they gone three games without a win, something that never happened in that Treble season, Sunday's Premier League game against Arsenal would feel even bigger. But Guardiola's subs saved the day. Haaland had a frustrating night against his favourite opponents. The Norway superstar had scored 11 goals in his previous six appearances against Leipzig, including five in  City's 7-0 win in March,  but failed to find the net with six efforts at the Red Bull Arena. But often when Haaland doesn't deliver, Alvarez does. He only had six touches - but two of them produced goals. He scored an absolute beauty himself and then returned the favour to Doku who ran through to net his first Champions League goal. \"We played a fantastic game in all departments. Everyone was perfect,\" added Guardiola. \"The substitutes all came off the bench with smiles on their faces, not complaining because they did not start.\" This also marked City's first win in Leipzig. The clubs have now met in three consecutive Champions League seasons, with Leipzig winning and drawing the others.

{"title": "Red Star Belgrade: Fans never stop believing 1991 European champions will rise again", "content": "Red Star Belgrade fans see their club as an empire. As they approach the game at Manchester City on Tuesday (20:00 BST), the facts are simple - both clubs have won the Champions League, previously branded as the European Cup, on one occasion. Pep Guardiola's troops did it last season, while Red Star lifted the trophy in 1991, but it doesn't really matter as far as heritage is concerned. \"They were the European champions, and nobody can take it from them. As far as the Serbian supporters are concerned, their club belongs among the greats,\" Mozzart Sport journalist Dejan Stankovic says. \"According to them, Red Star are bigger than Paris St-Germain, because the latter have never won the Champions League. And don't even dare to compare them with RB Leipzig. \"A lot of fans believe that Red Star's success on the international scene was interrupted by the civil war in Yugoslavia. If it didn't ruin everything, the Red-and-Whites from Belgrade would have been as powerful as Benfica and Ajax.\" That is why expectations are always too high. \"Public opinion in Serbia would never accept anything but total success,\" explains Serbian football writer Vladimir Novakovic. \"The national team didn't get out of the group at any competition since 1998, but they are always thought to be favourites. At club level, Serbia didn't have a single win in the Champions League before Red Star famously beat Liverpool in 2018, but they must do so again. \"It is not only related to sports. The sense of self-importance, or even grandeur, is the most confusing thing about the Serbs.\"  Last season was typical in that respect. Dramatically losing to Maccabi Haifa in the Champions League qualifying play-offs was considered a disaster, and the coach Dejan Stankovic immediately resigned. His replacement, Milos Milojevic, strolled to the championship title with an almost perfect record of 26 wins and four draws in 30 matches, but that still wasn't enough, as Red Star failed in the Europa League, finishing bottom of the group with six points. \"People were predicting that they would take 12 to 14 points from six matches against Monaco, Trabzonspor and Ferencvaros,\" Novakovic says. This season, fans are beaming with optimism more than ever, because for the first time Red Star qualified for the Champions League group stage automatically. That enabled the club to make thorough plans during the entire summer, both financially and professionally. Korean midfielder Hwang In-beom was purchased from Olympiacos for the club record of 5m Euros (£4.3m), while Senegalese striker Cherif Ndiaye arrived from Adana Demirspor for 4m Euros (£3.44m). Such expenditures were unheard of in the past, but arguably the most important change took place on the bench. Barak Bakhar was the coach who sent Red Star crashing out of the Champions League a year ago, and the 43-year-old Israeli was signed in May in order to transform the club and make revolutionary changes. Bakhar's success in his homeland had been nothing short of sensational. He led Hapoel Beer Sheva to their first championship title in 40 years in 2016, then successfully defended the crown in 2017 and 2018. In 2020, he moved to Maccabi Haifa, the sleeping giants who couldn't finish top for a decade, and duly guided them to three championship titles in a row.  Qualifying for the Champions League group stages and beating Juventus was the icing on the cake. Then he was ready for an experience abroad. \"Bakhar is capable of improving teams and installing a winning mentality, thanks to his tactical skills and leadership qualities,\" says Walla Sport editor-in-chief David Rosenthal. \"That is why Red Star chose him as they are trying to make a big step forward. The main problem is that it's unclear what would be considered an improvement, because Red Star are dominant in the league and winning the title is taken for granted. He would need to pick up points in Europe to prove his worth.\" Club management gave the new coach a free hand to make tough decisions, and several former key players have been discarded, including the Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, a massive fan favourite who was offloaded to Slovan Bratislava. Israeli keeper Omri Glazer, whom Bakhar brought in his place, was an instant success, and the initial results in pre-season friendlies were exceptionally good. That only made the expectations even higher, though, with the real tests still ahead. \"A foreigner was brought in order to make the necessary cuts without emotion, as some of the players were not up to the standards anymore,\" adds Stankovic.  \"Bakhar has full support so far, and everyone likes the speed of play and the offensive style. In the previous Champions League campaigns, Red Star had less quality and had to play defensively. Now they are capable of attacking - and fans can't wait to see that in Europe.\" Keeping expectations realistic could be a problem, though. \"Fans won't be happy if the team is thrashed 5-0 by Manchester City,\" says Stankovic. \"Everyone understands that Leipzig are a superior and well run club, but they are still considered 'small', and losing to them would be painful. Also, everyone expects at least to finish above Young Boys, which is actually far from certain.\" Red Star are shining bright now, but the downfall could be fast. Serbian press are notoriously merciless when a team fails, and knives are sharpened very quickly if the players and the coach don't live up to that much-remembered level of 1991.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66787895"},

{"title": "Feyenoord v Celtic: Wim Jansen & Henrik Larsson links in repeat of 1970 final", "content": "When the late Wim Jansen accepted the invitation to manage Celtic, one of the reasons he was seduced by the job were the similarities between Glasgow's sleeping giant and Feyenoord, the club with which he had helped destroy Jock Stein's dream of a second European Cup triumph 27 years earlier. Just three seasons after Lisbon, Celtic were favourites to lift the famous trophy again, this time in Milan's iconic San Siro. And, when one of the 1967 scorers Tommy Gemmell repeated the trick with a terrific opener, hopes were raised - but they would be shattered by Ernst Happel's underdogs. Feyenoord came back and deservedly won 2-1. Key men such as Jimmy Johnstone and Bobby Lennox were marked out of the game. The great Billy McNeill's rare misjudgement of a quick free-kick allowed the Dutch in for the decisive goal with just minutes left of extra time. The diminutive Rotterdam native at the heart of it all was Jansen. Despite standing at 5ft 5in when he dictated games from his deep midfield position, in the annals of Feyenoord Jansen is a bona fide colossus.  Only one man played more games for the club. He won four Eredivisie titles and would add the Uefa Cup to his crowning moment in Milan among other accolades. As the clubs prepare to do battle for just the second time in their Champions League group, Jansen - who  died in January 2022  - will be at the forefront of many supporters' thoughts on both sides. His impact on Celtic when he replaced Tommy Burns was much shorter than at the Dutch club but still deeply significant as he secured the Scottish title in 1998. It was the Parkhead club's first in a decade and, perhaps just as crucially, denied rivals Rangers a historic 10th successive championship. To help achieve this, he convinced the Celtic board to shell out £650,000 for the services of Feyenoord striker Henrik Larsson. The rest is history. With last season's Italian runners-up, Lazio, and three-time Champions League runners-up Atletico Madrid also in Group E, many feel the head-to-heads against the Dutch champions are where Celtic's best chance of wins will come from. The hosts were dealt a blow last month with a second wrist fracture of the calendar year to first-choice goalkeeper Justin Bijlow. Bijlow, reportedly a target for Manchester United, is likely to be out until the start of November. Highly rated right-back Lutsharel Geertuida is a fitness doubt and losing the 23-year-old would be a blow to Feyenoord head coach Arne Slot, who was in the frame for the Tottenham Hotspur job before turning down the opportunity, much to Celtic's chagrin. The Scottish champions lost Ange Postecoglu to the London club in the wake of that decision. Slot also has his problems at the top end of the pitch, with Santiago Gimenez suspended for their first two group matches.  The Mexican goal machine has scored six goals in six games this season and hit 28 last term as they won their first title since Giovanni van Bronckhorst led them to the summit of the Eredivisie in 2017. Gimenez was sent off in their second-leg thrashing by Roma in last season's Europa League quarter-final as the Italians once again denied them, having beaten them in the Conference League final just months before. New signing Ayase Ueda will also likely miss out against Celtic after picking up a knock in the wake of scoring in Japan's impressive 4-1 friendly win over Germany. Attacking midfielder Calvin Stengs may be the one who Slot will ask to lead the line on Tuesday, while other threats include wingers Luka Ivanusec and Igor Paixao. Slovakia defender David Hancko is an imposing figure at the back alongside captain Gernot Trauner. Celtic have never won their opening Champions League group match and this will be their last chance to do so, with Uefa refurbishing the competition from next season. Feyenoord are making their return to the group stage of this tournament for the first time in six years and will call upon the spirit of 1970 when they take to the field against Brendan Rodgers' side.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66841289"},
{"title": "Newcastle's historic Champions League campaign 20 years on", "content": "As Alan Shearer wheeled away, arm aloft in typical style, to celebrate yet another Newcastle United goal, something felt different. At the San Siro in March 2003, Shearer had just scored his second to put Sir Bobby Robson's Magpies in front against Inter Milan in the Champions League, before Ivan Cordoba levelled minutes later. Newcastle had battled hard across two group phases in that campaign to show they were equals to Juventus, Inter and Robson's former club Barcelona. Though they would ultimately fail to progress further, drawing 2-2 with an elite side in an iconic stadium created memories that will last a lifetime. On Tuesday, Newcastle return to face AC Milan in their first Champions League appearance for 20 years, evoking all those memories again. \"What a game,\" former defender Steven Caldwell tells BBC Sport. \"The San Siro is the stadium you think of if you grew up watching Italia 90; it is the stadium of my generation.  \"To see what it was like was amazing. It was an iconic moment for a football club that I love. \"It was a proper football match; there was a lot on the line, high stakes, against a world-class team. For us to compete was so incredible, we were so close, right in it, it could have gone either way.\" By the time Newcastle made it to Milan, they had more than left their mark in the competition, becoming the first team to lose their first three group games against Dynamo Kyiv, Feyenoord and Juventus and still progress, with famous wins against all three in the reverse fixtures. Back then, there were two group stages in the Champions League. And as they went to San Siro, Newcastle needed a victory as, after a heavy defeat by Inter in the first game, a sobering loss to Barcelona in the Nou Camp rain had followed before successive wins over Bayer Leverkusen.  The draw was compounded by another loss to Barcelona at home and the dream ended, but the night in Italy has become famous for the atmosphere than the football. \"The San Siro had an aura; it was an iconic, mythical place. Watching Newcastle play there was not on the horizon,\" Matthew Philpotts, writer for the True Faith Fanzine, says. \"It was about the experience as much as the result. Shearer's goal in front of the away end is etched on the memory. It seemed like everyone you knew was in Milan. The sheer number of fans was impressive.\" Robson had masterminded a meteoric rise after replacing Ruud Gullit as manager in September 1999. The Dutchman's reign had ended after a dispute with Shearer reached boiling point, the manager dropping the striker for a derby defeat by Sunderland, and the club were heading into the abyss. But the squad Robson built, mixing youthful exuberance with the experience he inherited, was as unpredictable as it was talented. They finished fourth in 2002. \"We had a lot of really energetic players like Jermaine Jenas, Kieron Dyer, Craig Bellamy and Laurent Robert,\" Caldwell recalls. \"The balance of that with Alan [Shearer], Shay [Given], Gary [Speed], was really unique and it made us difficult to play against. \"That squad was combustible. It wasn't the same kind of people; it was hard to keep everyone on track and Bobby did that excellently.\" The speed of the turnaround, driven by the sheer force of County Durham-born Robson's personality and passion for  club, initially caught up with Newcastle.  After making light work of Bosnian side Zeljeznicar Sarajevo in the qualifiers, a 2-0 defeat in Kyiv was compounded by a retrospective ban for Bellamy, before they were beaten at home by Feyenoord and, perhaps unluckily after a Shearer header was wrongly ruled offside, Juventus away. Victory over the Old Lady at St James' Park re-lit the fire. Defender Andy Griffin was the unlikely hero, helping Newcastle win by a single goal, with a little help from a deflection off goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. \"People will remember me for that goal and that game. Whether I scored the goal or not, it doesn't matter,\" Griffin asserts. \"The fact I started against Juventus, played 90 minutes and was involved in the goal and a win, was good enough. \"[Buffon] made a bit of a blunder. We managed to keep a clean sheet; people talk about the goal, but I put in a very good tackle right at the end when someone was through on goal. I almost pride myself on that as opposed to the goal.\" Shearer inspired them at home to Kyiv but it was the match away at Feyenoord which went down in folklore. Newcastle were 2-0 up thanks to Bellamy, back from his ban, and Hugo Viana before the Dutch side hit back quickly to level. Needing a goal to have any chance of progression, Bellamy scored in stoppage time to send everybody wild. \"It was crazy,\" Caldwell recalls. \"It is not often you lose yourself and become like a fan. We were so engrossed in the game.\" \"It was very much an emotional rollercoaster,\" adds Griffin. \"The final whistle went and our celebrations had to be put on hold because we had to wait for the result from Kyiv. Juventus beat Kyiv, which meant we qualified for the second group phase. \"We are all in the changing room, singing 'we are Champions League' and dancing around, totally enjoying the moment. It was one of the best games and highest highs I experienced.\" Bellamy would get sent off in the defeat at home by Inter, incurring another ban. Nobody embodied the difficult nature of that squad more, but Robson was the man to get the best from him when it mattered. \"Bellamy was a feisty little character,\" chief scout Charlie Woods, says. \"That was what made him so good. His contribution to the team was huge. \"Bobby wanted Shearer to play between the lines of the 18-yard box and he'd get Dyer and Bellamy to make runs in behind and get balls into the box. Alan was a great finisher. \"Bobby's man management was always great. He knew when to have a go and when to put his arm around people when it was necessary. He dealt with Bellamy superbly.\" For two decades, Robson's team has been immortalised for their exploits, but the anticipation on Tyneside as Eddie Howe's men look to emulate them is palpable.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66837176"},
{"title": "Feyenoord 2-0 Celtic: Champions League defeat for Brendan Rodgers' side in Rotterdam", "content": "Celtic's quest for a rare Champions League away victory goes on after having two men sent off in a second-half implosion to hand top seeds Feyenoord an opening group win. It was a night that began with such promise, as Brendan Rodgers' side started brightly in search of a first away win in the competition since  beating Anderlecht in 2017. But it ended with another painful European defeat that leaves them bottom of the group after Lazio and Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 in Rome. Things began to go wrong after a mature and composed opening half, when a long-range Calvin Stengs free-kick pierced the defensive wall and skimmed beyond Joe Hart. The goalkeeper might have done better. The defensive wall might have too. Celtic never quite recovered.   The goal lifted the Dutch champions, who had struggled until then, and they capitalised in the second half as Celtic's night completely unravelled. Gustaf Lagerbielke conceded a penalty for a tug in the box on Igor Paixao and was shown a second yellow card, before Hart offered some hope with a great save from Paixao's spot-kick. The task become too great, though, when substitute Odin Thiago Holm crashed wildly into a tackle and earned a straight red. Alireza Jahanbakhsh then made sure of Feyenoord's win after being gifted time and space to finish emphatically. It was the least the Dutch deserved, with further efforts disallowed either side of that goal as Celtic hung on. Ultimately, they got away with not losing by a bigger margin. Lazio come to Glasgow next. An already daunting challenge suddenly looks even tougher. The timing of the opener was such a hammer blow for Celtic. To that point they had more than matched their opponents, who struggled to engineer consistent pressure. Celtic had a good balance of being fairly solid, with a decent shape, composed on the ball in the main and carrying some threat. They had chances and one or two better decisions may have paid dividends. Daizen Maeda had two good opportunities, the first after after great work from Matt O'Riley, and Reo Hatate's shot was blocked. But the opening goal was absolutely crucial. Feyenoord returned with more purpose and tempo after half-time. It counted and Celtic's night fell apart . With nine men on the pitch it looked like a mission impossible. So it proved. Celtic will take some heart from that opening half but major lessons will need to be learned ahead of the visit of Lazio.  \"What we showed is that we're going to be competitive. We started really well. We looked a threat and progressed the ball. With better decisions we might've had an opportunity to get in front. \"Unfortunately we get two players sent off. It's a difficult level at 11 v 11. The players kept going, it was harsh on them. The first 60 minutes we were well in the game. They never gave up. \"With one or two more players coming back, it'll hopefully put us in really good stead for the remainder of the competition.\" \"They get the goal right before half time and that undoes a lot of good work from us. It would have been easy to lose three, four or five at that point which is testament to the group. \"Then to get two men sent off in quick succession takes the game away from us... we'll learn the lesson. \"There are five games to go so hopefully they'll be walking off thinking we didn't give up, we didn't quit, we were still fighting for each other at the end.

{"title": "AC Milan 0-0 Newcastle United: Eddie Howe's side draw on Champions League return", "content": "1114 Eddie Howe is confident Newcastle will grow in the Champions League after they marked their return to the competition following a 20-year absence with a creditable draw at AC Milan. Howe's side are back in Europe's elite club competition after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season, and this was their first match in a tough Group F that also contains French champions Paris St-Germain and German giants Borussia Dortmund. They were given a reminder of the difficulty of games in this competition as Milan dominated the first half, with Nick Pope saving well from Olivier Giroud and Theo Hernandez, but they rode their luck while defending superbly to earn what could prove to be a valuable point. For many of the Newcastle players - and for Howe himself - this was their first taste of Champions League football and the Magpies boss believes it could prove a valuable learning experience. \"You can't underestimate the difficulties of coming here - the emotion of the game, new experiences, we had to take a lot on board today,\" Howe said. \"I thought the crowd were very good for Milan. It was a hostile atmosphere and the players had to adjust to that and that is why I don't think you can underestimate the performance and point.  \"It will look better and better as time goes on. There were new experiences for a lot of us tonight and hopefully we can grow from this.\" Rafael Leao spurned a golden chance to score in the first half for the hosts as he fluffed his backheel after a fine solo run, and Newcastle were fortunate to go into the break level. But the game was more even in the second half. Former Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali saw a shot blocked for the visitors, while Tijjani Reijnders forced a decent save out of Pope with a low drive. Leao really should have won it in the closing stages when he got between Newcastle defenders to meet a cross, but he headed just over. Newcastle's first shot on target arrived in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Sean Longstaff saw a fierce effort tipped over, but in the end a point at the San Siro is certainly an encouraging result for the Magpies. Newcastle fans had travelled in their thousands to Italy, keen to be a part of history as their side made their return to the top table. Initially, the Magpies did not look overawed by the occasion as they passed the ball around well and attacked with numbers, but it did not take long for seven-time European champions Milan to take control. Newcastle perhaps showed their opponents too much respect in the first half, and it looked like a matter of time before Howe's side would fall behind, but they found their feet and their confidence. Aside from Longstaff's late effort, the visitors failed to create much of note, but they defended resolutely. Providing their team show more bravery in attack in future games, particularly at home, the Newcastle fans may see this as a valuable point later in the campaign. \"Nick Pope was outstanding today,\" said Howe of his goalkeeper. \"He was excellent against Brentford as well and it is no coincidence two big displays from him and two clean sheets, absolutely crucial for us.\" Milan were thrashed 5-1 by city rivals Inter on Saturday, but any hopes Newcastle had that their opponents would have a hangover from that result were quickly dispelled in this match. The hosts were difficult to break down defensively and attacked with pace and skill, and they really should have taken the lead in a first half that saw them have 15 shots at goal, seven of which were on target. Leao was guilty of Milan's biggest miss as he went from the sublime to the ridiculous in one incredible move midway through the first half. He initially showed fantastic footwork to breeze past three Newcastle players but then fell over when attempting to backheel into the net, when a more straightforward shot would have probably done the job. It was arguably Milan's best opportunity of the game, and last season's semi-finalists seemed to run out of ideas in the second half. With PSG and Dortmund to come, the home fans would perhaps have seen this fixture as their best chance for a home win, and it remains to be seen just how costly those first-half missed chances prove to be in the long run.

{"title": "Manchester City 3-1 Red Star Belgrade: Julian Alvarez double helps European champions come from behind", "content": "1107 Manchester City came from behind and Julian Alvarez scored two second-half goals as Pep Guardiola's men began the defence of their Champions League title with a win against Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade. European Cup winners themselves in 1991, Red Star threatened a famous win when Osman Bukari put them in front at the end of the first-half. But City took less than 90 seconds to level after the restart as Alvarez raced onto Erling Haaland's return pass, rounded Red Star keeper Omri Glazer with a superb piece of deception and squeezed the ball home from a tight angle while still running at full speed. Glazer spoiled an otherwise superb performance 13 minutes later when he went to punch Alvarez's free-kick away from danger but instead got only the faintest touch on the ball which did not divert it away from the far corner. Rodri's last European goal was the historic effort than secured the trophy against Inter Milan in June. The Spain midfielder ensured City took a successful first step towards this season's final at Wembley by scoring their third as he advanced unchecked into the Red Star box and guided a precise shot into the bottom corner. The hosts deserved their win - by the final whistle they had amassed 77% possession and had an incredible 37 shots to Red Star's three. While the excellent Alvarez could celebrate doubling his tally for the campaign, which now stands at four, it was a rare night of frustration for Haaland. With 30 goals in 26 Champions League games before this match, it is fair to say the 23-year-old has taken a liking to this competition. His 27th start in the Champions League will not be one that sticks in his memory though. At various points both the Norwegian and his manager were left shaking their heads at Haaland's failure to convert any of a growing number of opportunities he would normally have buried. It was a powerful header that triggered the negative response from Guardiola as Haaland rose majestically and met the ball powerfully, only for it to come crashing back off the crossbar. Shortly afterwards, Haaland seemed sure to score with a first-time shot on the turn from Alvarez's cut back, only to blaze over. City were ahead by the time Haaland probably sensed it was not to be his night. Again the Norwegian rose to meet a far-post cross a couple of strides from goal. This time he took the downward option. Glazer got a hand to it and somehow shovelled the ball on to the post, where it was cleared. Haaland had one more opportunity, another header, which he failed to keep on target. In this part of the world, Glazer is not a popular surname. For 45 minutes, Red Star Belgrade's goalkeeper generated the kind of irritation among City fans that the Manchester United owners tend to trigger at Old Trafford. The Israel international denied Rodri, Nathan Ake and Phil Foden during a one-sided opening period. Foden in particular, unmarked on the edge of the six-yard area in a reasonably central position, should have done better. Those chances formed part of a 22-shot barrage before the break that brought no reward, the most City have managed in the first half of a Champions League game without scoring. It meant there was incredulity among the City support when Bukari ran onto Mirko Ivanic's through ball and converted, sparking pandemonium on the Red Star bench after a long wait for the video assistant referee to overturn the initial offside decision. By that time Jeremy Doku had replaced Bernardo Silva, who did not look impressed to depart the action so early. When the interval whistle blew, Red Star - and Glazer - were dreaming of a famous victory, something the Serbian side have not achieved in England since 1973. The dream didn't last long.

Xavi's side were three goals ahead after just 23 minutes thanks to strikes from Joao Felix and Robert Lewandowski, plus an own goal from Jelle Bataille. Gavi added a fourth before Felix got his second after the break to give Barca's campaign the perfect start. The La Liga champions were eliminated in the group stage of their past two Champions League campaigns. Antwerp, who won the Belgian title last season to reach the Champions League for the first time, were unable to match the home side's passing and finishing. Barcelona have not won the Champions League since 2015 but here produced football reminiscent of those glory days, albeit against limited opponents. The opening goal certainly reminded of the times when Xavi roamed the Barca midfield with Mark van Bommel as his accompanying enforcer. For this game, they were instead in opposing dugouts - Van Bommel as Antwerp manager, Xavi in charge of Barca. In 2023, it is Ilkay Gundogan who Barca look to as their midfield creator. On 11 minutes, he exchanged passes with Lewandowski before sliding in Felix, the former Chelsea loanee firing home at the near post. The lead was doubled eight minutes later following a superb raking ball by Frenkie de Jong to Felix in the area on the left. The Portuguese forward, on loan from Atletico Madrid, clipped in a cross for Lewandowski to volley home from six yards. Antwerp were unfortunate to concede a third as their Champions League debut turned into a nightmare. Alejandro Balde's cross clipped off right-back Bataille and spiralled agonisingly over goalkeeper Jean Butez and in off the far post. Barca were passing the ball around their midfield at will and seemingly scoring when they wanted, Gavi smashing into the roof of the net after 54 minutes for his first Champions League goal. The scoring was appropriately concluded by the electric Felix, although his second was all about the left-footed cross by Raphinha. The former Leeds man cut back on the right wing before sending over an undefendable ball which Felix nodded home at the far post.

Labelled a \"mega game\" by Michael Beale, his pumped players delivered an electric opening following the weekend loss at Kilmarnock. James Tavernier netted a composed penalty before Cyriel Dessers bundled in his first goal for the club in the opening 15 minutes. The wasteful hosts could have effectively killed the tie, but the depleted Swiss visitors pulled one back out of nowhere just before the break when Dessers' handball - spotted by the VAR - allowed Chris Bedia to slam in a spot-kick. And the away side - missing several key players due to injuries, suspensions and visa issues - rode their luck before and after David Douline saw red for a second bookable offence to remain alive in the third-round qualifier. A glaring close-range miss by home forward Sam Lammers, just minutes before Servette were awarded their penalty, has the potential to become a major sliding-doors moment in the tie. But had the correct final pass been played during numerous breakaway opportunities, or had Dessers and Lammers not been thwarted by superb saves by Joel Mall, there would be simply no need to revisit the Dutchman's first-half sitter. \"We'll have to take the win and put in a good performance next week - we were always going to have to do that,\" Rangers manager Michael Beale told BBC Scotland.  \"This is the Champions League, so you know the other team are always dangerous and have good players. The job is only half done.\" The return leg takes place in Geneva next Tuesday (19:30 BST) in a game that will be live on BBC Scotland, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Overall, there is no doubt this was a much-improved performance from Beale's side. The way Rangers overwhelmed the Swiss visitors in the first half is everything the manager wants in his team. Dessers getting off the mark and bright flashes from Danilo on his first start are also positives.  Cantwell, who won Rangers' penalty with quick thinking on the blindside of Douline, also highlighted his importance to the Rangers midfield after his exclusion from Saturday's line-up.  But issues that plagued the Ibrox side's laboured performance in Ayrshire on Saturday crept into their second-half showing. Creating chances and missing them is one thing, not creating any is another. With Servette a man down, the visitors camped in and Rangers lacked the inspiration to kill the tie off - albeit that should have been accomplished with the opportunities created prior to Douline's dismissal. It is early days for Beale's new-look attack, but on first impression it appears to lack the explosiveness of a peak Ryan Kent. With the window still open, it remains to be seen whether he will look to address that after already spending heavily.  \"It was a fantastic start. We played with real energy, we ran forward, gave a lot to the game and created so many chances. \"The reality is at 2-0 it's a harsh penalty, but it is one, and that's what VAR is there for. \"Before that, the goalkeeper made two fantastic saves and we had a lot of good opportunities where you can see we're fine-tuning and we'll get better over time.\" \"It was a tough start for us when we went 2-0 down and they played at a high level but we got a bit of luck with the penalty. \"But overall the first half was balanced. We tried to attack but when we got a red card it was tough but it leaves us with the possibility for next week.\" Rangers are back in Scottish Premiership action on Saturday (15:00 BST) as they host Livingston before next Tuesday's return leg - live on the BBC - in Switzerland.

The French side are in Group F with Newcastle and AC Milan. PSG had the bulk of possession and chances but were frustrated for long periods by Dortmund, especially in the first half. Vitinha came closest in the opening 45 minutes, hitting the post with a bouncing 18-yard shot, while Randal Kolo Muani had an effort from the edge of the box deflected over the crossbar. PSG felt they should have had a penalty before the break when a corner struck the hand of Sule, but were denied following a video assistant referee (VAR) review - but the decision fell in their favour in the second half. A shot from Mbappe struck Sule's hand from close range, with VAR affirming the on-field call of penalty. Mbappe took the spot-kick himself and beat keeper Gregor Kobel with a shot into the bottom right corner. PSG made the three points safe before the hour in style.

{"title": "Servette 1-1 Rangers (agg 2-3): Tavernier header sends Scots into Champions League play-off", "content": "Rangers squeezed through to a Champions League play-off against PSV Eindhoven after surviving a fraught night against Servette in sweltering Geneva. A header from captain James Tavernier - so often Rangers' European talisman - salvaged a second-leg draw and slender aggregate win. Rangers' 2-1 lead from Ibrox had been nullified as Dereck Kutesa whipped a wonderful finish into the top corner in a torrid first half for the visitors. Danilo was guilty of an astonishing miss for Michael Beale's side - spooning over an open goal - but Rangers improved after the break, and substitute Cyriel Dessers ought to have made the victory more comfortable. Rangers will host PSV, who thumped Sturm Graz 7-2 on aggregate, next Tuesday before the return in Eindhoven the following week. A containment job was not part of Rangers' thinking in Switzerland, with Beale pledging to attack rather than look to protect on the first-leg advantage. However, his side's sprightly start soon evaporated and they were indebted to Jack Butland for two huge saves to deny Timothe Cognat and Kutesa either side of the opener as Servette caused havoc on the counter-attack. Danilo ought to have swiftly restored Rangers' aggregate advantage, only to somehow sclaff over the unguarded net from four yards after being picked out by Jose Cifuentes' terrific delivery. It was Brazilian striker Danilo's first - and only - touch in the Servette box during the opening 45 minutes. The interval came as welcome relief for the visitors. They regrouped and emerged re-energised, with Tavernier pouncing at the back post to meet a superb cross from Borna Barisic and power his header past Joel Mall. Rangers diligently limited Servette's threat thereafter and Dessers sent a header an inch too high then hit the post late on as chances to put the tie beyond doubt went begging. Rangers looked bang in trouble at half-time, but the nature of their response will hearten Beale as his reshaped side tries to find its feet. They denied Servette space down the flanks after the break and controlled midfield, where Cifuentes looks an impressive addition and Nicolas Raskin continues to thrive.  Further forward Rangers look disjointed, though, and Danilo in particular cut a forlorn figure. The Brazilian, who arrived from PSV for a hefty fee this summer, struggled to link play and his glaring miss was followed by Dessers failing to add a killer touch. Rangers are unlikely to get away with such profligacy against PSV as they look to defeat the Dutch for the second season running to reach the group stage.  \"We made a really slow start, we needed to dig in. At half-time we had to have some strong words as it wasn't what we were looking for. \"It was an excellent goal we scored. After that we could've extended our lead. The team showed a fantastic mentality.

So what is the state of play going into a huge few days of continental action? The Scottish Premiership champions go straight into the Champions League for the second season running. Brendan Rodgers' side will be in pot four for Thursday's draw in Monaco at 17:00 BST. Holders Manchester City are in pot one, along with Europa League winners Sevilla and the six domestic champions of the highest ranked leagues. There are five previous champions of Europe in pot two, including 14-time winners Real Madrid, who Celtic met last time, and Manchester United.

The Europa League now awaits Michael Beale's side, who made the competition's final in 2022. Among the confirmed pot one teams for the middle child of the tournaments are Liverpool, West Ham, Roma, Bayer Leverkusen, Villarreal and Atalanta.

{"title": "Rangers in Champions League qualifying: PSV Eindhoven will carry old and new threats", "content": "\"Time for revenge,\" roared PSV Eindhoven on social media in the immediate aftermath of their thrashing of the Austrian league's runners-up Sturm Graz. The three-word post was designed to demonstrate PSV's intent when they go head-to-head over the next eight days with Rangers for a place in the Champions League group stage for the second time in a year. Antonio Colak was the hero for Rangers in the Netherlands last season as the Scottish side ended a 12-year hiatus in Europe's premier club competition.  In a replica of that 3-2 aggregate triumph, the first leg is at Ibrox with the return on the road. PSV were undoubtedly favourites going into that decisive game in 2022, but the odds were upset at the end of a fairly even match. It was only 12 months ago, so while the fixture is the same, much has changed at both clubs. Including in the respective technical areas. Last term, Giovanni van Bronckhorst prevailed over his old international team-mate Ruud van Nistelrooy. Both would exit their roles before the season was finished for entirely different reasons. While Van Bronckhorst was ejected from his post in November after a Champions League campaign so bad it broke records, Van Nistelrooy exited on his own terms after helping PSV defend the Dutch Cup on penalties against Ajax, citing a lack of support within the club. There were also reports of dressing-room unrest. Unfortunately for Rangers, Van Nistelrooy's successor knows how to win games at Ibrox. Vastly experienced Dutchman Peter Bosz was in charge of Bayer Leverkusen and Lyon when they won recent Europa League games in Glasgow, although he wouldn't last much longer at either club as they dropped down their respective leagues. The 59-year-old has got PSV buzzing at the start of the season as they try to wrestle the title away from Feyenoord. It will have been six years since their last Eredivisie win by the time this season ends. As well as their destruction of Sturm Graz in the last round of qualifying, they have also won two from two in the league against Utrecht and Vitesse as well as lifting the Johan Cruyff Shield against the champions on their own patch in Rotterdam. Bosz's side have scored 13 goals in the process. They have also spent some big money during the summer transfer window, including breaking their own record transfer fee by signing Netherlands winger Noa Lang from Bruges for about 15m euros (£12.8m). Lang scored the winner in the Shield and also netted their first league goal of the season on the opening day. He is an injury doubt for the first leg but has travelled to Glasgow. Jerdy Schouten, another Netherlands player, has arrived from Italy, where he teamed up with Scotland midfielder Lewis Ferguson in the Bologna engine room last season.  United States players Ricardo Pepi and Sergino Dest have signed from Augsburg and Barcelona respectively, the latter on loan with a purchase option on the eve of the first leg. Last season's PFA Scotland young player of the year Malik Tillman also returns to Ibrox, but not in the way Rangers fans had hoped.  Tillman set up Colak for the only goal in Eindhoven last season, but he will be in PSV colours this time around having joined on loan from Bayern Munich for a seven-figure fee. While there are new dangers for Rangers to consider, old threats also remain.  Luuk de Jong leads the line and is ably supported by the likes of Joey Veerman, Johan Bakayoko and Ibrahim Sangare, who opened the scoring at Ibrox in last season's thrilling first leg. It is also worth mentioning youngster Isaac Babadi, the 18-year-old attacking midfielder in whom Bosz has placed a lot of faith during these early weeks of the season. Despite being shorn of Cody Gakpo, who starred against Rangers last season before leaving for Liverpool in a multi-million pound deal, PSV are probably stronger this time around than they were in 2022, meaning this is about as tough a match-up as Michael Beale's side could have faced at this stage of qualifying. The 1988 European Cup winners are unbeaten in 22 competitive matches and before next week's return in Eindhoven, have only lost once at home since Rangers beat them in Phillips Stadion.  In summary, this is an extremely dangerous tie for Beale and his side. Rangers will hope PSV are so consumed in their quest for revenge that they can repeat last season's trick.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66571195"},

{"title": "Rangers 2-2 PSV Eindhoven: Scottish side's Champions League hopes in balance", "content": "Rangers' hopes of successive seasons in the Champions League group stages remain in the balance after they cleaved out a tense play-off first leg draw with PSV Eindhoven at a boisterous Ibrox. Michael Beale asked his side to give themselves a platform for the second leg in the Netherlands and, although they lacked refinement at times, shovelfuls of endeavour kept them in the tie.  A tense Ibrox erupted with joy just before the interval when Abdallah Sima shaped in a splendid opener. But that hard-fought advantage would not last, Ibrahim Sangare benefiting from an outrageous Ismael Saibari stepover to thud in on the hour. When substitute Rabbi Matondo slapped Cyriel Dessers' teasing delivery into the net, it seemed Rangers might have a priceless lead to take in their luggage but, just like 12 months ago, the first leg would finish 2-2. Four minutes after Matondo's strike, Luuk de Jong soared to divert a towering header and ensure these sides will reconvene for a second leg in Eindhoven with both eyeing a place on the biggest stage.  \"Naturally we'll go across and be extremely positive,\" said Rangers manager Michael Beale. \"There were moments of tonight's game where I thought we were really good.  \"We were never fully in control because against this level of opponent it's hard to have the game fully under control. But with 10 or 12 minutes to go, we had the result under control.\" Rangers edged the return tie last year thanks to Antonio Colak's solitary goal, before going on to endure an utterly chastening campaign against Napoli, Liverpool and Ajax.  But to give themselves the opportunity to right some of the wrongs of the worst group stage return in the competition's history, the Scottish Premiership side will need to show more next Wednesday. They were second best for much of this game - more blood and sweat than pass and move at times - but demonstrated admirable resolve to eke out a creditable result.  Indeed, had Danilo shown a touch more composure when presented with an opening at the death, victory might have been theirs. Instead, they go against next Wednesday. And it's still anyone's guess how this tie will end. Beale had lavished praise on PSV's attacking prowess pre-match, and it almost seemed at times in the first half as if there was a hesitancy about Rangers when it came to committing men forward.   Borna Barisic and James Tavernier stayed deep, leaving Sima, Dessers and Todd Cantwell a little isolated. But the Ibrox side became more positive and reaped the benefits with Matondo's goal. That they conceded relatively cheaply so soon afterwards will sting, but Beale can reflect that his side can play better than this. Much better. They will need to next week but that is a challenge for another day.

{"title": "PSV Eindhoven 5-1 Rangers (agg 7-3): Champions League dream over for Michael Beale's side", "content": "Rangers' dreams of an immediate return to the Champions League group stage were extinguished in excruciating fashion by a ruthless PSV in Eindhoven. The Ibrox side had harboured hopes of exorcising last season's disfigured continental campaign but were unable to eject the Dutch from the competition in the way they did here last term. Ismael Saibari's first-half header nudged PSV ahead on aggregate for the first time in the tie, and the Moroccan added a second not long after the break. Game over? Not quite. James Tavernier's strike gave Rangers a slither of hope, but Luuk de Jong guided in a header within a couple of minutes, before Joey Veerman's suspiciously offside effort and a grotesque Connor Goldson own goal completed a chastening evening.  It means that instead of joining Celtic in the Champions League, Rangers will return to the Europa League group stage for their first foray in that competition since the 2022 final defeat in Seville. \"It's fair that PSV goes through,\" said Rangers manager Michael Beale. \"I thought the story of the two legs was we couldn't handle [Ismael] Saibari and [Luuk] de Jong.  \"I think we played against an excellent team over two legs. For this team coming together after a lot of change, this game came far too soon, that's what's clear.\" Despite an admirable opening quarter, this outcome always seemed the most likely once PSV ratcheted up their play to a level Rangers struggled to handle. Jack Butland had to make a couple of splendid saves and De Jong somehow planted a back-post header wide but the dam eventually burst. Saibari's first came after a piercing move and his second was a smart finish from a De Jong cutback. Both were befitting of his status as the best performer on the pitch. Striker De Jong added his name to the register with a glancing header, Veerman slewed in a shot amid shouts for offside, then Goldson got into a fankle trying to return a ball to Butland and ending up shunting it into his own net. Mercifully, it ended there, but only after Butland shovelled another couple of attempts away as PSV threatened to run riot on an evening when they vanquished a few demons of their own.   The Dutch had spoken all week about gaining revenge for last year. In the second half here, they franked that talk with deed. Beale had said his team were \"due a big performance\", but they were unable to deliver in this cauldron of noise. They are not the first - PSV have not lost here since November - but the manner in which they folded will be a cause for concern. What impact might that disappointment - and the physical toil of this tie - have on Rangers as they prepare for the season's first Old Firm game on Sunday?  That remains to be seen but, if he looks hard enough, the manager might be able to pick some scraps from this in the days between now and then.  What if Goldson's flicked header had gone the other side of the post? What if Rabbi Matondo hadn't scudded an upright after an outrageous dart through the PSV defence? What if they'd not conceded so soon after Tavernier guided in Sam Lammers' cross to make it 2-1? That, though, is all moot right now. What matters is Sunday. Celtic. Then the Europa League.  \"Obviously we scored three goals over the two games, but we're bitterly disappointed with the way we defended.  \"I thought the story of the two legs was we couldn't handle Saibari and De Jong. It's fair that PSV goes through.\" \"It's just disappointed with the manner of the goals but it's something that we have to brush off really quick because we've got a massive game at the weekend. \"It's still really raw and disappointing. We can't dwell on it too much. We've got to brush this off as quickly as possible. I know everyone's hurting. We've got to respond in a really good way.\" Just the small matter of an Old Firm game, with Celtic coming to Ibrox on Sunday (12:00 BST). And before then, the Europa League draw takes place from 12:00 on Friday.  PSV, for what it's worth, visit RKC Waalwijk on Saturday in the Eredivisie.

But some players and managers have criticised the move on player welfare grounds. \"It's absolutely absurd,\" said Boban, who captained Croatia's famous 1998 World Cup team to a third-place finish. \"Regarding player welfare, it's some kind of big tragedy because [they] are adding almost 12, 13, 14 minutes.\" Matches in England have often been running beyond 100 minutes since the start of the new campaign. \"When you play 60, 65 minutes - I can speak from my experience, especially as a midfielder - when you get tired, it's the last 30 minutes of the game. And then somebody comes and adds another 15 minutes,\" said Boban. \"How often we have spoken critically about the calendar and too many games. We are not listening to players and coaches [about welfare]. It's crazy! It's too much, so we will not do this. Our guidelines are different.\" Uefa's chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti backed Boban's comments and added that European football's governing body had been working for five years on other solutions to increase the amount of time the ball is in play. \"There is something more important than the accuracy of additional time,\" Rosetti said. \"Why do people like the Champions League so much? Because it's intensive, it's fantastic, the players never stop. \"We tell our referees to speed up the restart of play instead of focusing on stoppage time.\" Longer added time was first implemented by Fifa at the most recent editions of the men's and women's World Cup. It has been adopted in the Premier League  following a directive from football's lawmakers Ifab  to ensure there was the correct amount of added time to compensate what was lost for goal celebrations, substitutions, injuries and general time-wasting. The actual time increase in Premier League matches this season has been three minutes 23 seconds, with the average match length up from 98mins 26secs in 2022-23 to 101mins 49secs this term. Effective playing time is also up nearly four minutes from 54mins 57secs to 58mins 50secs. Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne ,  Raphael Varane of Manchester United  and global players' union  Fifpro  have also criticised the move to extend games.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66667887"},
{"title": "Saudi Pro League 'not a threat' and 'similar to China', says Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin", "content": "669 The Saudi Pro League has been dismissed as a competitive threat by Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football's governing body Uefa. The league has lured many high-profile players to Saudi Arabia over the last year, offering lucrative contracts and paying substantial transfer fees. Ceferin feels the Chinese Super League made the same mistakes and said \"that's not the right way to do it\". \"It's not a threat, we saw a similar approach in China,\" he  told L'Equipe. \"They bought players at the end of their careers by offering them a lot of money. Chinese football didn't develop and didn't qualify for the World Cup afterwards. \"That's not the right way to do it. They should work on player and coach development, but that's not my problem.\" Spending by Chinese Super League clubs was  curbed by a transfer tax  in 2017 but the Saudi Pro League has a  long-term investment plan,  with Michael Emenalo appointed as director of football to lead its  acquisition and youth development strategy. Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, who saw Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte leave for Saudi Arabia this summer, said the country's financial clout has  \"changed the market\" for transfers  and elite European clubs \"need to be aware of what is happening\". However, the Premier League's chief executive  Richard Masters has said  he \"wouldn't be too concerned\" about Saudi Arabia's growing influence in football. The country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken over four leading Saudi clubs including Al-Nassr, who signed Cristiano Ronaldo in December. Karim Benzema  and  Neymar  have been the biggest of many signings this summer while Al-Hilal made a  world record £259m bid  for Kylian Mbappe. Benzema and Neymar are aged 35 and 31, respectively, while 24-year-old France forward Mbappe has decided to stay with Paris St-Germain. Ceferin added: \"There are players at the end of their careers and others who aren't ambitious enough to aspire to the 'top' competitions. \"As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don't dream of Saudi Arabia. I don't believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia. \"When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they're playing.\" Ceferin also dismissed speculation that some Saudi clubs could join future editions of the Uefa club competitions or stage the competition finals. \"Only European clubs can participate in the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League,\" he said. \"Only European federations can apply [to host] a final, not even clubs. We would have to change all our rules, and we don't want that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66674368"},

{"title": "Manchester City's Treble 'written in the stars' says Pep Guardiola after Champions League win", "content": "1459 Manchester City's Champions League success was \"written in the stars\", said manager Pep Guardiola after his side sealed the Treble in Istanbul. City  beat Inter Milan 1-0  to win a first Champions League title, adding to the Premier League and FA Cup trophies they had already clinched this season.  \"I'm tired, calm and satisfied. It's so difficult to win,\" said Guardiola, who also won the Treble with Barcelona. \"It was written in the stars. It belongs to us.\" Midfielder Rodri's 68th-minute strike - just his second Champions League goal in 48 appearances - was enough to see off Inter Milan at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium. \"It's emotional. A dream come true. All these guys around here waited I don't know how many years,\" Rodri told BT Sport. \"They deserve it, we deserve it. The last years we were so close. I just want to thank everyone. It wasn't easy. What a team we faced, the way they defend and counter-attack. \"We gave everything. Finals are like this. You can't expect to play as well as always. Emotions and nerves are there. We competed like animals. It's a dream. This moment will never happen again.\" Manchester City were appearing in their second Champions League final in three seasons, having lost to Chelsea in 2021. They become just the second English men's team to win the Treble, following in the footsteps of city rivals Manchester United who achieved the feat in 1999.  Guardiola won the European Cup as a player for Barcelona in 1992 but said he did not realise what he had achieved until the day afterwards - and it will be a similar feeling after City's success. \"Our chairman said 'oh London is where next season's final of the Champions League is' and I won't tell you my answer to him,\" said Guardiola.  \"Now is time to celebrate. I am looking forward to Monday afternoon in Manchester on our coach and three trophies [as part of a victory parade].\" Guardiola joins United legend Sir Alex Ferguson as the only managers to win the Treble with an English side. \"It is an honour for me to be alongside Sir Alex Ferguson. I got a message from him this morning and it is an honour,\" added Guardiola. \"People say I have to win trebles every season. I am a good manager, but no. I like this competition for the fact we won it, it is part of history and players will be remembered for the rest of their lives. \"But now give credit for the five Premier Leagues won in six years. It is important now that people don't forget what we have done. Maybe they can create a museum so the fans can look at the trophies.\" City are still waiting for the result of the 115 Premier League financial charges against the club. They have denied financial wrongdoing and Guardiola  said last month  he wants the charges dealt with \"as soon as possible\".  After their Champions League triumph the manager praised the influence of owner Sheikh Mansour, who was watching on in the stands in Istanbul.  \"One of the main reasons why this club became where we are is people from Abu Dhabi - Sheikh Mansour taking over the club. Without that we wouldn't be here. They are the most important people,\" he said. \"They support me unconditionally in the defeats in this competition. In many clubs you are sacked so I give incredible credit to my hierarchy and to my CEO.\" Striker Erling Haaland joined City last summer and netted 12 goals in this season's Champions League - the joint-most in one campaign for an English club alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester United in 2002-03. The 22-year-old Norwegian also broke the Premier League record for most goals in a season with 36, scoring 52 times in all competitions. \"In my wildest dreams I would never think of this,\" Haaland told BT Sport.  \"It shows it's possible for a guy from a small hometown in Norway. It gives hope to younger people in my hometown. It's unbelievable. \"After a couple of days when this settles a bit and this feeling of winning this trophy, I will want to do it again for sure. I know myself and I know this is how I will think. \"We have to defend what we have achieved this season. That's how it works. In a month everything is forgotten and we have to start again.\" Haaland said it was \"really special\" to work with Guardiola, who won two Champions League trophies with Barcelona before guiding City to their first.  \"We have a good relationship and I look forward to next season to develop even more,\" he added. \"To be getting trained by him every single day, the best coach in the world, is a good place to be.\" Midfielder Kevin de Bruyne was consoled by Haaland when he was forced off with a hamstring injury in the first half, just two years after his appearance was cut short in the European final defeat by Chelsea. \"It has been a hard two months,\" said De Bruyne. \"I had a lot of problems with my hamstring and it snapped. \"The team was good enough though and we won. We have been working so long for this, it is amazing.\" Guardiola's biggest decision before the match was to leave England defender Kyle Walker out of the starting XI. Walker had started City's past seven matches, including the FA Cup final victory over Manchester United and both legs of the Champions League semi-final win over Real Madrid.  \"I'm always going to be disappointed when I'm not playing but I'm 33. My example [is important for] the younger lads,\" Walker told BT Sport.  \"I made a speech before they went out. I said 'my dream is in your hands, no pressure'. This club means so much to me. To experience what I've experienced, I'm forever in debt. \"I'm over the moon. I'm rarely speechless. My dream has come true, to achieve this with this club. To achieve a Treble is unbelievable. \"My mum and dad are in the stands. From where I come from in Sheffield it's not easy. I remember when my mum didn't have a pound for the ice cream van. To have this with them, I'm so thankful.\" England international Jack Grealish, who joined City from Aston Villa  for a British record £100m  in 2021, was in tears at full-time. \"This is what you work your whole life for. I'm so happy. I was awful [in the final] but I don't care. To win the Treble with this group of players is so special,\" Grealish told BT Sport. \"Everyone who knows me knows how much I love football and this is what I have worked for my whole life. Seeing my family in the crowd makes me so emotional. \"I just said to the manager 'I want to thank you'. He has put so much faith in me. He is a genius.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65868994"},
{"title": "Champions League: FA has 'healthy paranoia' for Wembley 2024 final", "content": "Ensuring the 2024 Champions League final at Wembley is a success is giving the Football Association \"healthy paranoia\", says chair Debbie Hewitt. Fans at this month's final between Manchester City and Inter Milan in Istanbul reported issues with transport, water and toilet facilities. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin admitted on Thursday that  \"not everything was perfect\". That followed major crushing at the  2022 final in Paris. Uefa's own investigation found it \"remarkable\" there had been no deaths at the final between Real Madrid and Liverpool, when fans were penned in and teargassed outside the Stade de France. There were scenes of  major fan disorder and security breaches  when Wembley hosted the Euro 2020 final in July 2021, when England lost to Italy. \"There is pressure on every event we hold,\" said Hewitt. \"We are running the national stadium. If something happens in that arena… we have paranoia. It is healthy paranoia I would say.\" Uefa will decide on hosting rights for Euro 2028 later this year, when a combined United Kingdom and Ireland bid will face competition from Turkey. That means the success of the 2024 Champions League final will have no material impact on the bid decision. However, Hewitt is keen for the lessons of Paris and Istanbul to be learned - and also from the Euro 2020 final, when turnstiles were stormed by ticketless fans who entered the stadium in huge numbers. \"You have to search for the thing that is different,\" said Hewitt. \"It isn't the regular stuff that goes wrong. It is the stuff that hasn't happened. \"That night was the first time we had 30,000 empty seats. It is easy for me to stand here and say that is obvious, that is the thing that was different. You have to search for it. \"Secondly, it is absolutely crucial that all the stakeholders who are going to make a difference are in the same room. It is no good the police doing their bit in one room, the stewards doing their bit in another, us doing our bit in that room and Uefa doing theirs in that room. \"It is about getting everyone in the same room and testing each other's plans to destruction. I believe in a process called pre-mortem, not post-mortem.\" The Football Association moved the kick-off time of the pre-season  Community Shield  between Manchester City and Arsenal on Sunday, 6 August from 17:30 BST to 16:00 following complaints by fans over concerns about travel on public transport. Hewitt believes the move was proof of an organisation being willing to listen to complaints and factor those in with the competing demands of numerous stakeholders, including the broadcasters. \"Whenever we set a kick-off time, we have a multitude of stakeholders, many of whom people won't even know,\" said Hewitt. \"Everyone talks about the broadcasters because they are an important stakeholder. But it is the local communities, it is the police, what else is happening on the day. It is never that easy to say 'one voice trumps all'. \"This is a good example of where we listened and corralled the stakeholders to say 'this is important to make a change'.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66018306"},
{"title": "Champions League: Istanbul final not 'perfect' for fans - Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin", "content": "Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has accepted \"not everything was perfect\" for fans after criticism about the Champions League final in Istanbul. There  were reports  of fans having to walk extended distances along busy roads, queue for hours for transport to and from the stadium and being left without water as Manchester City beat Inter Milan on 10 June. Uefa previously apologised after  Liverpool fans were penned in and teargassed  before last year's final in Paris. European football's governing body had not previously addressed the issues experienced by supporters in Istanbul. However, at the opening of the four-day European Football Fans Congress in Manchester, Ceferin accepted problems had arisen in Turkey that needed to be addressed. \"Given what some of you experienced recently, I would understand if I got a cold reception tonight,\" he said. \"We are well aware that in Istanbul not everything was perfect. I am certainly not playing down the problems encountered by some.  \"But let us continue working together to improve what can we improve.  \"I'm thinking in particular transport links to and from stadium, the hosting of the stadium supporters and access to water and toilets for everyone.\" Football Supporters Europe is collecting fan accounts from Istanbul to present a report to Uefa. Ceferin said Uefa's other major finals in the men's and women's games had passed without significant issues. The showpieces in 2024 - when Wembley will host the Champions League final and Germany the European Championships - will be a \"unique experience\" for fans, he added. Ceferin used his opening address at the National Football Museum to praise fans for  protesting against  the proposed European Super League in 2022, saying: \"You were the captain and led the team in the match of our lives.\" However, memories of the chaotic scenes in Paris remain fresh in the mind, as do the initial attempts by Uefa and French authorities to blame supporters for events outside the Stade de France. Uefa's own review concluded European football's governing body bore \"primary responsibility\" and it was \"remarkable\" it had not led to loss of life. The review added that attempting to blame ticketless fans was \"reprehensible\". \"I have come here to say sorry,\" Ceferin said. \"We would love to erase events that happened last year from our memories. \"Last year everyone welcomed our decision to move the final from St Petersburg to Paris and in the end we all know what happened. \"Good intentions are many times not enough. We know that and we are sorry for that.\" Earlier this week, West Ham were stopped from selling tickets to fans for their first Europa League group game next season due to the behaviour of fans at the Europa Conference League final in Prague.  Premier League referee Anthony Taylor was  also verbally harassed  at an airport in Budapest last month following the Europa League final, leading Ceferin to address fan behaviour. \"We must shout, call out and rid ourselves of these idiots, who discredit both football and the fans,\" he said. \"Let's rid ourselves of those who pour out the hate towards football officials, the referees, Uefa staff, federations and leagues.  \"They are fans like you. They love football like you and they have families like you.

{"title": "Manchester City: Why Treble-winners' domination provokes questions as well as praise", "content": "2799 Manchester City's Champions League triumph in Istanbul felt like one of the most momentous results in football for years. It ended City's long pursuit of the trophy they coveted most. And by sealing only the second Treble an English club has managed, it ensured the team and their manager will always enjoy legendary status. Add in the fact that when arch-rivals Manchester United managed the only previous Treble  in the 1998-99 season  City were down in the third tier, and the significance of what is a remarkable sporting journey becomes clear. City had overtaken United on and off the pitch long before Istanbul, of course. But victory reinforced the sense of a seismic shift in the sport's balance of power - in Manchester, domestically, and now across the European game, where many believe Pep Guardiola's team could dominate as they have in England. They conquered Europe at a time when the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Saudi Arabia own PSG and  Newcastle United  respectively. When a member of the Qatari ruling family is  bidding to buy Manchester United.  It came just days after it was announced  Saudi finance was about to shake up the way golf is run globally.  For many, Istanbul was another major milestone in the broader theme of Middle Eastern investment into sports. There is much to admire about the way City play, Guardiola's coaching, and their wider system and global structure - one that now includes a state-of-the-art academy, and 13 clubs under the umbrella of the  City Football Group (CFG). City's under 18s recently became the  first ever  to win three successive national championships. City's under 21s have also just become the first to secure a hat-trick of consecutive  Premier League 2 titles. And, since 2016, City's relaunched women's side have also won the FA Cup on three occasions and the Women's Super League once. And yet, as well as renewed admiration, City's triumph also means additional scrutiny. The extremely rare sight in Istanbul of majority owner Sheikh Mansour - whose sovereign wealth has transformed the fortunes of the club - at just his second City match since taking them over via his Abu Dhabi Investment Group in 2008 - was a vivid reminder of some of the questions and issues that swirl around the new champions of Europe. The fact Mansour - the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - was at his first City match for 13 years inevitably led to more questions over the motivation for his ownership. Human rights campaigners believe the club is being used to 'sportswash' what Amnesty has called the \"deeply tarnished image\" of the oil-rich UAE.  Last month,  more than 40 NGOs  accused the UAE of a \"sustained assault on human rights and freedoms, including targeting human rights activists, enacting repressive laws, and using the criminal justice system as a tool to eliminate the human rights movement\". The UAE has also had one of the world's highest per-capita carbon-emission rates. But evidence can be provided of a strong investment that has added value, not simply a soft power vehicle in an attempt to diversify its economy and boost tourism. City can point to the fact that while about £1.5bn has been spent on new players since 2008, Mansour bought City via a private equity group for £200m, and they are now  estimated to be worth £4bn,  with a  £42m profit announced last year. There is also renewed focus on the UAE's foreign policy, with scrutiny of Abu Dhabi's relationship with the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  In March, the US government said it was \"concerned\" UAE companies had exported millions of pounds worth of goods to Russia, helping the country to get round international sanctions. Last year, the UAE abstained from a US-led vote at the UN condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And in October, Putin hailed Russia's ties with the UAE during a meeting with the country's president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.  'MBZ' - as he is known - is also the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and sat next to his brother - Sheikh Mansour - at the Champions League final. The UAE has been a key Western ally in the Gulf region, with the country conducting billions of pounds worth of trade with Britain. But last year  the UK government was critical of Mansour  after a meeting between him, other UAE leaders, and Syrian president Bashar-Al-Assad.  A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said at the time such meetings \"undermine the prospect\" of peace in Syria. City did not respond to requests for comment.  Syria, and the Assad regime, remain under US and European sanctions.  It is not just international politics that make the club's Abu Dhabi ownership controversial. As well as the Treble, City's season was notable for the catalogue of  more than 100 alleged financial rule breaches  between 2009 and 2018 that the Premier League charged the club with.  City were also accused of failing to co-operate with an investigation. According to experts, the league appeared to be claiming sponsorship income linked to City's owners was artificially inflated.  City deny wrongdoing, saying their innocence is supported by a \"body of irrefutable evidence\". In 2020, they successfully overturned a two-year Uefa ban from European competitions for financial fair play breaches, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport clearing the club of \"disguising equity funds as sponsorship contributions\". The alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred, although  City were fined for failing to co-operate with Uefa's process. But until the Premier League case is concluded - and that could take years - suspicion over exactly how City have achieved their success, along with talk from rival fans of asterisks next to titles, and possible points deductions if found guilty, will inevitably continue. Such intrigue only adds to those concerned that City's dominance and wealth could be affecting the competitive balance of the sport. That the Premier League is starting to become too predictable, with City champions five out of the past six seasons.  Next season, City will be favourites to win a fourth consecutive league title - something no team in the history of English football has achieved.  On the European stage, too, there have been concerns the  multiple-club model  allows City to stockpile talent, and many of the continent's traditional powers will be worried the club could emulate Real Madrid, who have won the Champions League five times in the past decade. Little of that will bother many of the City fans who experienced the joy of Istanbul, of course, and of those who were at the Etihad to watch their team dismantle the likes of Arsenal and Real Madrid in recent weeks.  Or many of those who  braved the rain to witness this week's victory parade.  Especially those old enough to remember the years when they existed firmly in the shadow of their then dominant neighbours United. Many (but not all) such fans believe envy lies behind much of the criticism City receive, and make the point other clubs have enjoyed similar eras of dominance in the past, and that other Premier League rivals have spent similarly vast amounts without managing the success that City have enjoyed. They believe City should just be celebrated. But there is still too much to be resolved, and too much intrigue surrounding those who own the club, for it ever to be as simple as that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65902861"},
{"title": "Champions League qualifier first leg: BK Hacken 3-1 New Saints - Conor Roberts keeps visitors in tie", "content": "The New Saints were made to pay for a terrible start in Sweden after losing 3-1 to BK Hacken in their Champions League qualifier. Saints recovered from conceding two goals inside the opening 12 minutes of this first leg in Gothenburg. Striker Declan McManus salvaged a goal only for the Swedish champions to strike a third before half-time. However a series of Connor Roberts saves offered Saints a glimmer of hope ahead of the return match next Tuesday. Manager Craig Harrison knew his team had been handed a \"really, really tough\" draw having admitted his surprise that the Swedish league winner were unseeded for the Champions League. Other than an injury to Adam Wilson, TNS were at full strength for this first leg at Hisingen Arena in Sweden's second city. Hosts Hacken, third in Sweden's top-flight Allsvenskan, were without Benie Traore who had been allowed to travel to  hold talks with Premier League-bound Sheffield United. However the loss of their star striker did not blunt Hacken's attack with two early goals. Ibrahim Sadiq was allowed too much space by Chris Marriott. His first effort was blocked but the Ghana Under-20 international volleyed in the rebound from a tight angle on seven minutes. Danish midfielder Mikkel Rygaard doubled the lead five minutes later when he casually directed his volley past goalkeeper Conor Roberts and the omens looked worrying for TNS. Hacken continued to dominate possession but were twice denied by Roberts before TNS finally found a foothold. Daniel Redmond had the goalkeeper stretching with a long range effort before McManus headed in on 32 minutes. Marriott released Jordan Williams down the left flank and his cross was perfectly met by last season's top-scorer. However Hacken almost immediately restored their two-goal advantage, though in controversial style. Rygaard's indirect free-kick looked have sailed directly into the corner of the Saints' net but VAR ruled centre-back Even Hovland was both onside and had made contact. It was a tough break for the visitors who almost cut the lead again only for McManus to fire wide on the stroke of half-time. However a vastly improved, if scrappy, second half display kept Saints in contention. Josh Daniels was left bloodied, Rory Holdon went close with a rare chance and Roberts pulled off two more outstanding saves in injury time set up a an intriguing tie at Park Hall on 18 July. The winners will progress to the second qualifying round against either Ki Klaksvík of the Faroe Islands or Hungarian side Ferencvaros. The losers of the tie will go into the Europa Conference League second qualifying round and will face Slovakia's Slovan Bratislava or Swift Hesper of Luxembourg. Saints, who won the Cymru Premier title for the 15th time last season, have made no secret of their ambition to become the first Welsh club to reach the group stages of a European club competition. The club has set its sights on emulating the likes of Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers and Gibraltar's Lincoln Red Imps in reaching the group stage of the Europa Conference League within the next five years. \"Hacken are full of quality and international players and were every bit as good as we thought they would be,\" he said. \"But our boys deserve a lot of credit. They could have crumbled after the early goals but we're work on becoming resilient. They put their bodies on the line, finished strong and Connor has made some great saves. \"As crazy as it sounds, we're still in this. At 4-1 it may have been a bridge too far. But if we get the first goal next week, it's all on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66153618"},

Now, in a town in west Iceland, the 2023-24 Champions League is set to begin on Tuesday - the last season before the format changes completely. BBC Sport takes a look at this season's competition, some of the teams that will be playing, the key dates of the matches and how the tournament will be different next year. Kopavogur in Iceland will be the venue for the four-team preliminary round featuring sides you can be forgiven for never having heard of. Two of Atletic d'Escaldes (Andorra), Buducnost Podgorica (Montenegro), Tre Penne (San Marino) and Breidablik (Iceland) will move into the next phase - and the winner of that contest on 30 June will advance into the first qualifying round and a tie with Irish side Shamrock Rovers. After the preliminary round, come three two-legged qualifying rounds before the two-legged play-offs in August, with the group stages beginning in September. A total of 78 teams from 53 countries will play in either qualifying or the group phase, although, once again, there will be no Russian sides as they are still banned by Uefa following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. As has been the case in every season since 2003-04, 32 teams will play in the group phase, divided into eight groups of four, with the top two advancing into the last 16 and the teams coming third dropping into the second-tier Europa League. The draw for the group stage takes place on 31 August and Spain will have five teams involved as Sevilla won the Europa League but finished outside the top four in La Liga last season. Newcastle will be playing in Europe for the first time since 2012-13 after coming fourth in the Premier League, with Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United the other English entrants. Teams from the same country will not be drawn against each other in qualifying or the group phase. Brendan Rodgers' Celtic qualify automatically for the group stage, but Rangers come in at the third qualifying round and need to get through two rounds to join their rivals. Union Berlin finished fourth in Germany's Bundesliga and will be in the Champions League for the first time. After the group phase ends in mid-December it will be the last 16 in 2024, then the quarter-finals and semi-finals - all played over two legs - before the final at Wembley on 1 June. To see the full Champions League fixture list click here. This will be the last season of the existing format - 32 teams in the group phase, split up into eight groups of four, with the top two advancing - with widespread changes coming in for 2024-25. The new format will see 36 sides, with two of the four extra places awarded to countries whose clubs have performed the best in the previous campaign. If the new format had been introduced for 2023-24 and not 2024-25, Liverpool and Atalanta would have been in this season's Champions League because of the performances of English and Italian clubs in European competition in 2022-23. From 2024-25, all teams will now play eight matches (instead of six) against eight different opponents, with four home ties and four away. All 36 sides will be ranked in one single league table - three points for a win, one for a draw and none for a defeat. The top eight in this table will go straight into the knockout stages, while those from ninth to 24th will compete in two-legged play-offs to join them in the last 16.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65954427"},

{"title": "Champions League qualifier: Larne fall to early penalty in Helsinki on competition debut", "content": "Irish Premiership champions Larne lost 1-0 away to HJK Helsinki after conceding a penalty just three minutes into their Champions League debut. Bojan Radulovic scored from the spot-kick twice, after his first attempt had to be retaken, to win the first leg of the first-round qualifier for the Finns. Larne recovered from going behind so early on and came close to equalising twice through midfielder Leroy Millar in what was an impressive second-half display. \"I think we under-performed, to be honest, in the first half,\" said Larne boss Tiernan Lynch.  \"It's the first time in the Champions League and we were a little bit in awe and we maybe gave them too much respect.  \"We had a little bit of a conversation at half-time about being a bit braver, giving a better account of what we are as a team and a club. I think we definitely did that in the second half.\" The second leg will be played at Solitude, home of Cliftonville, on Wednesday after Larne's artificial pitch at their Inver Park base failed to meet the required Champions League standards.   Having qualified for Europe's premier competition by winning the Irish Premiership for the first time in their 134-year history last season, Tiernan Lynch's men produced a well-drilled and creative performance after the break. They had an excellent chance to equalise on the hour-mark when Lee Bonis won a free-kick just wide of the area. Dylan Sloan delivered a curling free-kick and Millar had a free header at the back post but guided his effort wide. Millar, last season's Player of the Year in Northern Ireland, had another chance to level on 77 minutes, with Sloan again the architect as he cut the ball back cleverly to the edge of the box, but Millar could not keep his shot down under pressure from a defender.  Larne's hopes of keeping things tight in the early stages suffered a disastrous setback inside the opening minute when defender Cian Bolger made an awkward challenge on Topi Keskinen on the left hand side of the penalty area and Georgian referee Goga Kikacheishvili pointed to the spot. Radulovic sent goalkeeper Rohan Ferguson the wrong way from the penalty spot, only for the referee to order a retake, but the Spanish-born striker kept his nerve to once again wrong-foot Ferguson and find the bottom corner. The same two players from the penalty incident were again involved as Keskinen ran off Bolger, but as the Finnish player bore down on goal, Shaun Want was on hand to take the sting out of the shot with the ball running through harmlessly to Ferguson. Kekinen then burst down the left and and cut the ball back across goal for the on-rushing Matti Peltola to shoot from the edge of the penalty area but his effort was deflected behind. Having weathered the early storm, Larne began to gain a foothold in the game and carved out a decent opening five minutes before the interval when Ryan squared for striker partner Bonis, but the Northern Ireland international's rushed effort was blocked.  The hosts threatened soon after the break when Radulovic released Santeri Hostikka on the right hand side of the penalty area but keeper Ferguson was able to comfortably block the effort at his near post. Ryan and Bonis had further attempts for the visitors in between Millar's two opportunities, with the former curling just over from the edge of the box after a fine sweeping move and the latter drilling into the side netting from a tight angle.  The 1-0 defeat leaves competition debutants Larne very much still in the tie ahead of the second leg in Belfast next Wednesday.  \"You hope so,\" said Lynch when asked if his side could pull off a result at Solitude.  \"I think the longer the game went on there was definitely more belief. Without being arrogant or cocky, we tried to talk to them about how we deserve to be at this level.  \"A huge part of the first half performance is a lack of confidence or a lack of belief because it was their first time and you are maybe a little bit in awe of the surroundings, a full house and all that goes with it.  \"But I think 11 v 11 we don't have a huge amount to fear as long as we can put the performance in that we did.\" Formation    4-3-3 Formation    4-3-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66179385"},
{"title": "Barcelona provisionally cleared to play in Champions League amid Uefa payments probe", "content": "Barcelona have been provisionally cleared to play in the 2023-24 Champions League amid a Uefa investigation into allegations the club made payments to a referees' chief. In March, European football's governing body  confirmed it was looking into claims  of payments made by Barcelona for favourable refereeing decisions. Barcelona have denied any wrongdoing. While Barcelona have been allowed in Europe, Uefa reserved the right to punish the club in the future. The Uefa investigation came after a  criminal investigation  was brought by the Barcelona public prosecutor's office on 10 March. It was alleged that Barcelona paid 8.4m euros (£7.4m) to Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, the former vice-president of Spain's referees' committee and his Dasnil 95 company. Barca, former club officials and Negreira were indicted for \"corruption\", \"breach of trust\" and \"false business records\". Uefa said: \"The investigators in charge of the case are invited to continue and finalise their investigation and to send a further report to the appeals body if and when they consider that the admission/exclusion of FC Barcelona [in the Champions League] should be assessed.\" The payments, revealed in February by radio station Ser Catalunya, came to light following an investigation by tax authorities into Negreira's company Dasnil 95. Barcelona made payments to the company totalling a reported 1.4m euros (£1.2m) between 2016 and 2018, and paid Negreira, 77, about 7m euros (£6.2m) between 2001 and 2018, the year he left his role with the referees' committee. Barca acknowledged the club had paid Dasnil 95, which it described as \"an external technical consultant\" to compile video reports related to professional referees \"with the aim of complementing the information required by the coaching staff\". It added that contracting the reports was \"a habitual practice among professional clubs\". The affair escalated when 18 of the 20 La Liga clubs issued a statement to express \"deep concern\" over the situation, and Barcelona president Joan Laporta said the club would launch an internal investigation into the payments.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66330753"},
{"title": "Marseille: The first and most controversial Champions League winners, 30 years on", "content": "In 30 years of the Champions League, there has not been a winner more controversial than the competition's very first. Marseille remain the only French side to win the Champions League since the European Cup was rebranded for the 1992-93 season. In the 1993 final, Raymond Goethals' side beat the legendary AC Milan of Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten. A single goal from sweeper Basile Boli secured a 1-0 victory in Munich; Marseille were European champions. Not even the Paris St-Germain of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar have managed that. That achievement, though, would be overshadowed by a match-fixing scandal that led to Marseille being stripped of the Ligue 1 title they won that same season, and relegated from the French top flight. First, the good stuff. While the maiden Champions League is unrecognisable from its current form - just eight teams in the group stage, with the pool winners qualifying for the final - Marseille managed the impressive achievement of going through the whole competition unbeaten. Their president Bernard Tapie - remember his name - had invested heavily in the squad following their defeat by Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 European Cup final. In defence, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and centre back Marcel Desailly were signed, while striker Alen Boksic was acquired to score the goals. The Croatia international obliged with six in the 1992-93 European campaign, as did midfielder Franck Sauzee. With three wins and three draws from six group games, Marseille narrowly edged out Scottish champions Rangers to meet Milan, who started the final as overwhelming favourites. The Italians had won the European Cup in 1989 and 1990, and powered through their group with six wins from six. However, on 26 May 1993, they could find no way through the Marseille defence before or after the 44th minute, when Boli met Abedi Pele's corner at the near post and flicked a header into the far corner past motionless Milan keeper Sebastiano Rossi. The events for which Marseille's 1992-93 campaign would become infamous, however, had taken place some days prior to that final. As well as chasing European success, they were locked in a Ligue 1 title race with PSG and Monaco which went down to the final day, staged the week before the meeting with Milan. Marseille visited relegation-threatened Valenciennes needing a victory to be sure of the title - and they got it, winning 1-0 to complete part one of their double. However, reports soon emerged that all was not as it seemed. Valenciennes player Jacques Glassmann said he had been offered 250,000 francs - at the time around £30,000 - to \"take his foot off the gas\" by Marseille midfielder Jean-Jacques Eydelie, a former team-mate at Nantes. Two other Valenciennes footballers, Jorge Burruchaga and Christophe Robert, were also offered bribes. Robert's wife went to the Marseille team hotel to pick up a bag of notes, which was later found buried in her mother's garden. Criminal investigations began, as did the footballing recriminations. Marseille were stripped of the Ligue 1 title, relegated and denied the right to defend their Champions League title. Runners-up PSG turned down both the Ligue 1 title and Marseille's Champions League place, with owners, TV company Canal+, worried about losing subscribers in the south of France. And so third-placed Monaco took over the 1993-94 Champions League slot, while the honour of being 1992-93 Ligue 1 champions was left vacant in the record books. Marseille, though, were allowed to keep their continental crown, as there was no evidence any of the match-fixing had taken place in European matches. Thus they remain the inaugural Champions League winners, albeit with a gigantic moral asterisk next to their name. Tapie was handed a two-year jail sentence - of which he served eight months - while Eydelie, then 27 and seemingly approaching the peak of his career, was given a suspended sentence and banned from football for 18 months. Eydelie did return to football, but never to his Marseille heights. After a nomadic few years - including a loan spell with Walsall - he retired in 2003. Eydeliewas not done with Marseille, though. His autobiography, released in 2006, claimed players were given suspicious injections before the game against Milan. These claims were backed up by his team-mates, including Chris Waddle and Tony Cascarino. \"Players were injected all the time at Marseille,\" Waddle told the Sun in 2003. \"The club doctor said the injections would help our recovery after games. I had a couple of injections but they didn't make any difference. \"I don't know what it was, but no-one ever failed drugs tests and nothing illegal showed up.\" Cascarino, writing in the Times later that year, added: \"To this day I don't have a clue what it was. The doctor would only tell me that it would give me an adrenaline boost and I never felt inclined to ask the rest. \"Whatever the substance was, my performances improved. I cling to the sliver of hope that it was legal, though I'm 99% sure it wasn't.\" Uefa rechecked the anti-doping tests taken at the time and confirmed they were negative, while Tapie unsuccessfully sued Eydelie for libel. It provided a dark coda to an infamous tale. The first-ever winners of the Champions League will forever remain shrouded in controversy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65595744"},
{"title": "Champions League final: Szymon Marciniak to remain as referee after speaking at event organised by Polish far-right leader", "content": "Szymon Marciniak will remain as the Champions League final referee after he apologised for speaking at an event organised by Polish far-right leader Slawomir Mentzen. Poland's Marciniak, 42, will take charge as Manchester City face Inter Milan in Istanbul on 10 June. There were calls for him to be replaced after he attended the Everest business conference in Katowice on 29 May. Uefa said after an investigation that \"we unequivocally reject the values promoted by a group linked to this conference\". Marciniak, who refereed the World Cup final between Argentina and France in December, said he had been \"gravely misled\" and \"completely unaware\" about the affiliations of the conference. \"I want to express my deepest apologies for my involvement and any distress or harm it may have caused,\" he said in a statement. Poland's Never Again anti-racism association had called on the referee to distance himself from far-right activities.  Mentzen, co-chairman of the far right and libertarian Confederation party, has focused on his libertarian economic views in recent times but caused controversy in 2019 when he announced his five-point slogan, which was anti-Semitic and homophobic. He had said the business conference had \"nothing to do with politics\", and called the \"denunciation\" of Marciniak \"absurd\". The Polish sports minister Kamil Bortniczuk and the country's deputy foreign minister also defended the referee. Marciniak said: \"Upon reflection and further investigation, it has become evident that I was gravely misled and completely unaware of the true nature and affiliations of the event in question. I had no knowledge that it was associated a Polish extreme-right movement.   \"Had I been aware of this fact, I would have categorically declined the invitation. It is important to understand that the values promoted by this movement are entirely contrary to my personal beliefs and the principles I strive to uphold in my life. I am deeply remorseful for any perception that my participation may have contradicted them. \"I wholeheartedly condemn any form of hate, discrimination, or intolerance, as they have no place within the sport or society as a whole. \"Moving forward, I pledge to be more vigilant in scrutinising the events and organisations with which I associate myself. I am committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that such lapses in judgment do not occur in the future. \"Lastly, I extend my sincere apologies to the clubs, players, fans, colleagues, officials and organisations who place their trust in me. I fully comprehend that my actions have had repercussions beyond personal disappointment, and I am fully prepared to accept any consequences resulting from my ill-advised participation.\" Uefa investigated the incident and said it acknowledged Marciniak's apology and said the Never Again group \"requested that Marciniak remain in his role... firmly asserting that removing him would undermine the promotion of anti-discrimination\". \"Based on the information provided, Uefa confirms that Marciniak will fulfil his role as the referee for the Champions League final,\" European football's governing body said. In a letter to Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin, Bortniczuk said the business conference had nothing to do with politics and that the referee had delivered a 45-minute inspirational talk at the conference. Bortniczuk said the referee had no contact with the far-right leader at the conference. Polish deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablonski said untruthful accusations against Marciniak are \"an immense scandal\". The Confederation party has nine MPs in the Polish parliament - Mentzen is not one of those. In recent polls, it has placed as high as third before this autumn's parliamentary elections.

Saints drop into the Europa Conference League and will host Swift Hesper of Luxembourg. Swift Hesper were beaten over two legs by Slovakia's Slovan Bratislava and drop into the Conference League. Hacken go on to take on Ki Klaksvik of the Faroe Islands in the Champions League second qualifying round. Saints started well, but their slim chances of overhauling the visitors ended when Sadiq struck the opener, having also done so as they won 3-1 in the first leg in Gothenburg. Sadiq's shot took a deflection as it beat Connor Roberts' dive at the post in the 19th minute. Roberts blocked another effort from the Ghana Under-20s international with his legs soon after. Craig Harrison's Cymru Premier champions barely threatened in the opening period against the team who went into this game second in Sweden's top-flight Allsvenskan. Harrison had left the strike power of Declan McManus on the bench with the former Scotland Under-21s international nursing an injury in the build-up. Saints were livelier after the break with Ben Clark prominent as they sought an equaliser, but their efforts proved in vain.

{"title": "Champions League final: Inter Milan striker Edin Dzeko facing former club Manchester City", "content": "When Inter Milan face  Treble-chasing Manchester City  in the Champions League final on Saturday they could be spearheaded by a 37-year-old who was cast off by the Citizens eight years ago. Edin Dzeko's goals helped propel the Sky Blues to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and an EFL Cup. For Inter, the striker could cap off his star-studded career with a Champions League winners' medal having already scored the crucial opener  in his side's semi-final win  over bitterest rivals AC Milan. If anyone can stop Pep Guardiola's all-conquering side, it might just be the \"intelligent\", \"influential\" forward out to seek revenge on his former club. After all the build-up, Inter needed just eight minutes to take the lead against AC Milan in their  Champions League semi-final first leg. Hakan Calhanoglu chipped in a corner which Bosnian Dzeko had the presence of mind, and quality, to meet with a hooked left-footed volley into the top corner. \"There are so few top strikers in the world that score that type of goal,\" former Scotland forward Pat Nevin told BBC Sport.  \"It was behind him, you expect him to take a touch but he guides it. What a finish, a cracker!\" Dzeko's goal kickstarted  Inter's 3-0 aggregate win.  Across both legs his work-rate and hold-up play continuously created chances for team-mates. \"He's a very intelligent football player, he has a finesse about him as well,\" said Italian football expert James Horncastle  on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He is a very technically gifted footballer, he can come short and play as a number 10. He is involved all the time.\" Dzeko may still be scoring well into his 38th year, but City fans will always remember him for one particular finish. Trailing Queens Park Rangers 2-1 on the final day of the 2011-12 season, Dzeko rose highest to head home a dramatic 92nd-minute leveller. Minutes later, and thanks to Sergio Aguero's legendary winner,  City lifted their first Premier League title. Without Dzeko, though, there would be no Aguero moment. \"I just think the longevity, it's very rare to still be able to play at this level, after being so good so long ago, and still have an impact,\" said  European football expert Julien Laurens. \"It's the same with Ibra [Zlatan ibrahimovic] and Paolo Maldini and all of those guys. I still don't know at 37 how you can be so influential in such a big game. It's crazy.\" Of the 18 players in City's squad from that famous day against QPR 11 years ago, only goalkeeper Joe Hart and midfielder James Milner were still playing Champions League football this season. Former international team-mate Asmir Begovic puts Dzeko's agelessness down to his excellent work ethic. \"He is a world class player,\"  he told BBC Radio 5 Live.  \"It is no surprise to me he is doing this, having known him for 15 years. \"He is dedicated to the game, disciplined, looks after himself immaculately. He leads the front line perfectly.\" Dzeko, who grew up in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war, began his football career in 2003 at local side Zeljeznicar. Then a creative midfielder he would soon move to Czechian outfit FK Teplice and then on to Felix Magath's Wolfsburg in 2007. Nicknamed the 'Bosnian Diamond', Dzeko would score 85 goals in 142 appearances for Wolfsburg helping the German side lift the Bundesliga title in 2009 for the first time in the club's history. \"In the 2009 Ballon d'Or rankings he finished 13th,\" added Laurens. \"I find it amazing. He was the 13th best player in the world 14 years ago and now he's still scoring important goals.\" In January 2011  he joined City for £27m.  At the time, only Robinho (£32.5m) had cost the Premier League side more. Dzeko's first goal for the club was a late equaliser  to prevent an embarrassing defeat by Notts County  in the fourth round of the FA Cup. City would go on to win the competition that season, their first trophy for 35 years. After helping City to two Premier League titles, Dzeko left for Roma, at first on loan and  then permanently in October 2015. He was Serie A's top scorer in the 2016-17 season,  before moving to Inter  six years later where he has lifted the Coppa Italia in each of his past two campaigns. \"His career shouldn't be underestimated,\" added Horncastle.  \"He's been the top scorer in two of the top five leagues. He is a big-game player.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65740400"},
{"title": "Champions League final: Simone Inzaghi - the 'nice guy' who turned Inter Milan fortunes around", "content": "\"The phone rang,\" recounted Giancarlo Inzaghi, father of Inter Milan boss Simone. \"It was Romelu Lukaku.\" \"My son tried to convince him,\" Inzaghi Sr told Gazzetta dello Sport. \"'Here, you are the king. It will be different in London.'\" It was too late. The Belgium striker had decided he was going back to Chelsea, much to coach Inzaghi's disappointment. \"It was like losing three players in one fell swoop,\" he moaned to his father following Lukaku's move in 2021, only three months after Inzaghi joined Inter. Inzaghi arrived with hopes of continuing the marvellous work of predecessor Antonio Conte. The aim was to win back-to-back titles but, with big-name departures, including Lukaku, Inter missed out on the Scudetto. Fast forward to April this year and, rather than challenging at the top of the table after their star striker returned on loan, Inter were sixth. Three consecutive defeats and a draw at lowly Salernitana had elevated the pressure and Inzaghi seemed exasperated by Lukaku's profligacy. By the beginning of April, Lukaku had scored only three league goals, two of which were from the penalty spot. Rumours emanated from every crevice of every tabloid. The striker and Inzaghi don't see eye to eye. Apparently. Inzaghi was on the brink. Allegedly. Inter were in crisis. Definitely. Monza were next, a newly promoted team and yet another loss for Inter. Their 11th defeat of the season. The vultures were circling. In life we are taught that nice guys finish last, but that is especially true in football in Italy. Inzaghi was accused of being just that - a nice guy, a company man. Yet, as Inter now prepare for Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester City, that was one of the many reasons he was picked for the role. When CEO Beppe Marotta arrived in December 2018, he was tasked with returning Inter to former heights. Forced to sit back and watch Juventus dominate for nine years, Inter yearned to break their hegemony and become a force in Europe once again. Marotta was the architect behind Juventus' dominating success. Alongside right-hand man and protege Fabio Paratici, he developed a long-term project that yielded an immense amount of joy and trophies. So when Juventus decided not to offer their star director a new contract in August 2018, choosing to count on Paratici instead, Marotta moved on to the competition. At Inter, he found a home and a club in need of his expertise. Alongside their other directors, Marotta formulated a winning project aimed at restoring glory and it started in the dressing room. A healthy and happy atmosphere breeds success, and Marotta's first priority was to remove all toxicity, even if it meant sacrificing great talent. Certain players left and were replaced by those willing to grow, to listen and to adapt. Next was the development of a winning mentality. Inter is a notoriously inconsistent club where the highs are high but the lows can be depressingly low. They are called 'Pazza' (crazy) Inter for a reason. They needed a manager who could discipline and inspire winning consistency. In came Conte, the mentality monster. Scudetto achieved, Juventus' hegemony broken. Check. Europe was the next dream and, when Conte left, Marotta had different requirements of his successor. He sought peace and stability at the top, a dependable figure who wanted the job for the long term and would thrive despite the financial limitations of the club. Someone who could establish a great rapport with the players, elevate the style of play and succeed in Europe to bring in the big money. Marotta had followed Inzaghi for some time. After all, he was Paratici's childhood best friend. Familiar with his character and burgeoning talent, Marotta watched Inzaghi build and win with Lazio despite the hardships suffered at that club. He was to be Conte's successor but was he the right character? As we have grown to understand, Inter do their best work when presided over by maniacal characters willing to kill for the win - the Jose Mourinhos or Contes of this world - men who always had something to prove. Inzaghi was the normal one. He lacked the flair for theatrics. He would complain a lot and he can be rather annoying on the sidelines, but his bark is always worse than his bite. Losing to Spezia in March despite boasting 70% possession and taking 28 shots left critics bewildered. Forget the title; forget even challenging. The Nerazzurri were no longer defined by their winning mentality but by their lack of ruthlessness and the endless squabbles on the pitch. The team reflected their leader's personality and Inzaghi's job had to be on the line. Endless headlines noting potential successors made the rounds on the front pages of the sports newspapers, yet Inzaghi never wilted under the pressure. If anything, the most difficult moments seemed to strengthen his focus. According to his assistant coach, Massimiliano Farris, the loss to Bayern Munich in the group stage of the Champions League was followed by a dinner in which Inzaghi insisted they could do it - they could overcome Barcelona and power forward in Europe. They did. The draw against Salernitana in April gave the coach the same sensation. With their backs against the wall, Inzaghi flipped the script. He wasn't going to fight; that only provoked fear. It was time to lighten the mental load, to lower the intensity in training and to get back to enjoying football. Inter began winning again. They bulldozed Lazio, who under Maurizio Sarri finished the season in second place. Rarely have we seen a Sarri side cowering deep in their own half as they tried to contain a savagely hungry Inter. That win came just after Inter comprehensively defeated Empoli a week before. The greater emphasis on individualised training and the lowering of intensity in group training was getting the best out of Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez and they have since become unstoppable. In his past 11 matches, Lukaku has scored seven times and delivered five assists. Martinez has scored 10 in his past 12 matches. Inter were not only winning but enjoying their football. The squabbling that threatened their season was replaced with healthy banter and a lot of laughter. Inzaghi instructed them to think of nothing but of how they could help their team-mate. No complaining, no gesturing on the pitch - \"we do this together\", as a team, as the family they had become. When the Nerazzurri believe in themselves, they are Italy's indomitable presence. They can overwhelm you into oblivion with their technique and athleticism by attacking in waves, or they can sit deep, hand over possession and counter-attack swiftly. They can switch out their strikers and their wing backs while the bench-warmers can be even more menacing. They can be direct or pass around you and they are combative and dirty when they want to be. Inzaghi studies opponents endlessly to concoct the perfect gameplan. He responds to his critics where it matters - on the pitch. Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri walked away whispering criticisms of Inter after being knocked out of the Coppa Italia. Inter have won every match but one since, securing their second trophy of the season and now fighting for a third. They may never possess the quality of Manchester City, but they are a side who deserve their place in the final.

{"title": "Champions League final: Vote for the best", "content": "Manchester City face Inter Milan in the Champions League final on Saturday as they look to complete the Treble. Could it join the list of great showpieces in the competition? The last three finals have all ended 1-0 so it is time for a classic, surely. BBC Sport has picked 10 of the most iconic finals to date - which has meant some classic games did not make the cut. Read through them all and pick which one you think was best at the bottom. Whether you remember this game as the Loris Karius or Gareth Bale final probably depends on whether you are a glass half full or half empty person - or whether you support Liverpool or Real Madrid. Liverpool keeper Karius, who never played for the club again, threw the ball directly off Karim Benzema and was helpless as it rolled in for the opening goal. Sadio Mane equalised but Bale came off the bench and, two minutes later, scored a stunning bicycle kick. And there was still time for a second Bale goal and Karius error as the German fumbled in the Wales forward's long-range shot. A great Barcelona performance against Juventus in the Spanish giants' most recent Champions League win. Ivan Rakitic put Barca ahead after a fine passing move before Alvaro Morata scrambled home an equaliser. Luis Suarez put the Nou Camp side back in front after Gianluigi Buffon failed to hold Lionel Messi's shot and Neymar added a third with the last kick of the match. That sealed the treble in Luis Enrique's first season in charge. Atletico were seconds away from a truly great season. A week after Diego Godin's goal against Barcelona won them the La Liga title, the defender's goal against city rivals Real Madrid looked set to seal the Champions League too. But Sergio Ramos' stoppage-time header sent the final to extra time, with Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo scoring in the final 10 minutes to give Real their 10th European Cup. It is hard to imagine a more perfect farewell to a club than Didier Drogba's for Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final. 'Hosts' Bayern Munich looked set for victory through Thomas Muller's goal before Drogba's 88th-minute header forced extra time. Drogba - with his last kick before leaving the Blues - scored the winning penalty in the shootout. Let's not mention the penalty he conceded in extra time which Bayern missed. Or the fact he came back to Chelsea two years later. During Barcelona's peak under Pep Guardiola they beat Manchester United twice in Champions League finals, in 2009 and again in 2011. Legendary United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said after the 2011 final: \"No-one has given us a hiding like that.\" Barcelona delivered a Wembley masterclass, with Lionel Messi in inspired form. Pedro gave Barca the lead, with Wayne Rooney equalising before goals from Messi and David Villa. You know a game is special when it has a proper name. The phrase  'the miracle of Istanbul'  is more familiar than calling this the 2005 Champions League final. Liverpool seemed down and out when they trailed 3-0 at the break to Paolo Maldini's first-minute effort and Hernan Crespo's double. But the Reds were a new team after bringing on Dietmar Hamann for Steve Finnan at half-time - as Steven Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso scored in a seven-minute spell before the hour mark. Jerzy Dudek saved penalties from Andrea Pirlo and Andriy Shevchenko in a 3-2 shootout win to seal a famous triumph. Hampden Park did not necessarily host the best final, but it was the scene of the best Champions League final goal (until Bale's bicycle kick anyway). Raul gave Real Madrid the lead before Lucio levelled for Bayer Leverkusen in their only Champions League final. But Zidane watched the ball drop from the Glasgow air before spinning and firing a perfect volley past Hans-Jorg Butt from the edge of the box. Still the most dramatic finale any Champions League final has seen. Manchester United trailed for 85 minutes following Mario Basler's early goal - and still won thanks to two stoppage-time goals from substitutes. Teddy Sheringham slotted home a 91st-minute equaliser from close range, before he flicked a corner into the path of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer two minutes later to seal the Treble. No English team have won the Treble before or since, although that could change on Saturday. Not the best final but iconic because it contained one of Europe's greatest young teams. Ajax - with an average of 23 - were unbeaten in the Dutch league all season and won the Champions League final against AC Milan thanks to a late goal from teenage substitute Patrick Kluivert. Louis van Gaal's starting XI in the final had nine Dutch players, including seven youth-team products, with most of them going on to be household names. One of the best, if not the greatest, Champions League final performances in only the second year after the European Cup was rebranded. AC Milan's 4-0 win over Barcelona - who had been the favourites - remains the biggest margin of victory in a Champions League final, and the joint biggest in any European Cup showpiece. Daniele Massaro gave Fabio Capello's Milan a 2-0 half-time lead, with Dejan Savicevic and Marcel Desailly scoring after the break.

{"title": "Manchester City: 'Hysterical and 'hated at times' - Pep Guardiola is the greatest", "content": "Pep Guardiola became the first manager in history to win the Treble twice when his Manchester City side beat Inter Milan to lift the Champions League trophy on Saturday. Having already achieved the holy grail of league title, domestic cup and European glory with Barcelona in 2009, Guardiola and his City players became the 10th team to ever achieve the feat. Guardiola is the greatest coach football has ever known. Not because he wins things - 17 major trophies and counting - but because he has changed football.  I recently met up with one of Europe's most coveted young coaches and the conversation turned to what made the 52-year-old Spaniard special. \"Pep gave an instruction to Joao Cancelo,\" the coach told me. \"I heard it and all I could think was: 'I know what you are about to do and I can't defend against it.'\" The coach said what made Guardiola so special is his search for perfection is relentless, even though it doesn't need to be. His team are good enough to win anyway. But he still pushes for 100%. Former France, Arsenal and Barcelona striker Thierry Henry recently told Guardiola he is \"the greatest manager of all time\". Others have a similar view. Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho says he can convince you that what he tells you is what is going to happen in a match. Then gives you all the information you need to deal with the situation. \"The way I see football now… I'd never, ever seen it like that before I met him,\" he said. Recalling the team talk before Barcelona's 2011 Champions League final success against Manchester United, midfielder Javier Mascherano said that as Guardiola spoke, it was as if he was referring to a game that they were playing there and then. He said: \"You shut your eyes and you were out there in the middle of the action. During the match I was thinking: 'I've seen this already. Pep has already told me about it.' \"Everything that he said would happen, happened as he said it would.\" Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan describes him as a \"genius who reads the game and covers every situation imaginable\". According to the late Johan Cruyff, from the moment Guardiola took charge at Barcelona in 2008, all he wanted to do was, \"make football better, take his team to another level\". Former Argentina boss Jorge Sampaoli has called him \"the coach with the most imagination in football\". He has an ability to get the very last drop out of his team and a ruthless, dispassionate willingness to discard players unable to give him total commitment. Those qualities, matched by the standard of his players, put him light years ahead of the rest. An anecdote that encapsulates Guardiola's philosophy occurred just after he had taken over at Barcelona in 2008.  His goalkeeper Victor Valdes explained: \"I remember my first conversation with Guardiola. It was in his office at the Nou Camp. He had a tactics board with two small magnets either side of the goal just outside the box. He said: 'Do you know which players these two are?' \"He said: 'These are your centre-backs.' I had no idea what he was talking about and he said: 'When you've got the ball. this is where I want them to be.' I thought he was crazy. \"Then he said: 'You'll pass to them. And it's from here we'll build the play.' I still thought he was completely mad. But given I'm a bit crazy myself, I felt in tune with him. So I replied: 'The defenders would have to be brave and want the ball.' Pep said: 'Don't worry, that's my job. I'll make sure they want it.' And that's how it all started\". The door was opened to a new world. From then on, his job has been to convince players through his training sessions to do what he needs them to do. That is something that goes against the grain for most footballers. Let's remember for a moment how football has evolved; it comes from the streets, from each player and his own individual initiative. But gradually it becomes a more organised collective process. While Guardiola has said in the past that \"the player is the one who deserves all the credit\", you sense that he knows that the player without instructions is nothing. This Manchester City side are an optimum version of him. Eleven players all working towards a single idea. A coach's dream. That is no less than he demands. In the past - at Bayern Munich and Barcelona - when he felt he no longer had that, he packed his bags. Guardiola has pushed football into new directions.  In 2008, the prevailing football concept was about solid, organised defensive structures, from which quick transitions were played. Guardiola was the pioneer in constructing a team built not to use the defence as a means of closing the game up, but rather as the starting point of attack. \"He is the first coach to start working on what is theoretically called 'the construction phases of the attacking game,'\" explained Pep Segura, a former sports director of Barcelona, and perhaps the person who has studied most the influence and legacy of Guardiola. \"He starts by working the exit phase [the building from the back] and then the construction phase, what happens when the ball gets to midfield. He developed those two and started working on the third, preparation phase of the last pass.\" His demands are based on simple principles. Keep possession, play it simple and play it fast. And sometimes it can come at a price. Bernardo Silva has admitted in the past to some Portugal team-mates that he has frequently become tired at Manchester City because of the constant repetition and exhausting demands, although it is these measures that have taken him to the level that he is today. Guardiola is like the schoolteacher that you only appreciated in later years but hated at the time because he demanded so much more of you. Not all players grow under his intensive training demands. Those that progress will do so because they learn a better reading and knowledge of the game, better positioning, and better support for team-mates. There is an enormous psychological pressure on the player to do what he must for the team. In that, we see one of Guardiola's greatest attributes: his ability to change the mentality and thinking of those players that have no desire to be changed.  Since leaving Barcelona, he has coached Thomas Muller, Franck Ribery, Silva, Kevin de Bruyne, and Jack Grealish, all of whom - despite their forceful personalities - have bought into his philosophy. Dani Alves once said of Guardiola at Barcelona: \"If Pep had told me to jump off the third tier of the Nou Camp, then I'd jump because I'd think there must be a good reason for it.\"  Guardiola is constantly on top of every situation, always correcting, always demanding more. Sometimes, his players can get frustrated. It happened with De Bruyne during the emphatic Champions League semi-final win over Real Madrid in May. At one point, the Belgian lost possession, and Guardiola expressed his disapproval. Exasperated, De Bruyne shouted: \"Shut up, I'm fed up with hearing your voice.\" That voice continues to cajole teams towards success. Each each club he has managed, Guardiola has moulded his ideas to fit, without ever giving up on his essence. The basic philosophy doesn't change. Neither do the demands on his players. He spends most of his waking hours planning ways to be one step ahead ahead of his opponents. His sleeping pattern is unconventional, with messages sent to his coaching staff at early hours in the morning. He often relies on long siestas during the day to recharge his batteries. He spends most of the time indoors and his family have developed a routine. His wife Cristina continues running her shop in Barcelona and lives there with son Marius and daughter Valentina. Their other daughter Maria, an Instagram influencer, lives in London. The family get together with the use of a private jet.  Not many in the boardrooms at Guardiola's clubs have understood fully his processes. But they know they work. Khaldoon Al Mubarak, Manchester City's chairman, knows he has a leader with an extraordinary capacity for work and sometimes he has to make allowances for some of his insecurities. Guardiola prepares everything to win. If he does not get the right results, he becomes \"hysterical\", as a close friend said with humour.  Khaldoon witnessed that after the first draw of Guardiola's second season. \"It is impossible, I will never be able to do what I want to do, impossible,\" he kept shouting in his private room after the game.  The chairman's role is to calm him down and remind him of the club's total support. Guardiola needs the insecurity, the drama to feed himself. If necessary, he even makes drama when there is none. It is a mixture of obsession, the need to control everything. He has to feel that everything matters. It is his way to check if his passion is still there.  He has been known to demand a better presentation of the food. He wants the perfect behaviour from security personnel. He likes to see those in reception smile. He wants players to feel the standards are the highest they have ever experienced.  He has four short meetings per game. Every season, he has between six and 10 meetings with everyone - from waiters and medical staff to physios and receptionists - in a room at the training centre. Everyone is squeezed like sardines in a can. He reminds them they have to keep pushing.  If a Guardiola team wins, outsiders say he is a genius. If he loses, they say he overthinks, the laziest word ever to be used about Guardiola's work. They are missing the point. The standard of excellence does depend on having the very best players, a stick sometimes used to beat him with without understanding the trail he is blazing for new coaches and players. There is more to come. His friends and those closest to him believe that City will be his last club before he takes charge of a national side. Guardiola is the most advanced coach in the game. His ideas work on the four phases of attack and developing them. The first - the build-up - is the one Valdes has explained. From that opening phase, much depends of having one more player than your opponents in a particular area of the pitch.  The second phase - constructing the play - is based on numerical superiority attained by moving players into different positions and lines of attack. Who else would have thought of achieving this by converting John Stones, a centre-back, into one of City's most effective midfielders? The third stage is all about creating the final pass, the assist. This is the one Guardiola believes is still a work in progress. That phase is one he has worked harder on in the last couple of years - the movements of full-backs, centre midfielders and forwards before the last pass. He uses the last 10 minutes of training to do that, instead of letting players do shooting or crossing.  He knows, despite City's success, he is not yet there with that third stage, nor with the establishing of the fourth stage, the 'finalising' - the technical coaching term for finishing. There is a sense there that football culture is not yet ready for what he wants to do. Players want to have the freedom to dribble when they want, and shoot when they want - and not when they are told to. But it will happen. It is part of his continuous search to refine the way of thinking about and playing the game. Many are watching on and learning. His new football culture is here to stay. In the Premier League alone, there are at least five managers who have been inspired by him - Thomas Frank, Marco Silva, Mikel Arteta, Erik ten Hag and Roberto de Zerbi, soon to be joined by a sixth, Vincent Kompany.  The influence is not all one way. Guardiola has taken on board things he has learned from Brighton's De Zerbi. But the world game has felt the impact of Manchester City's manager. Seven of Spain's starting line-up in the 2010 World Cup final came from his Barcelona side. Five of Germany's 2014 winning first 11 came from his team at Bayern. There are the titles, domestic and European, that he has won. Ultimately, though, his most notable achievement can be found everywhere from the grassroots to the top of the game. When people thought there was nothing new to invent in terms of how to play football, he proved them wrong. Guardiola has built a reputation for seeing things others don't. Fresh challenges lie ahead. In two years' time, when his contract expires, he will leave Manchester City. He has been surrounded by people who prepared the ground for his arrival, and who have given him the tools to take the game to a new place. After City, he will receive offers from national teams, where that kind of work will not be possible.  Whatever happens, though, we should enjoy Guardiola's football - the product of an amazing brain.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65832657"},

{"title": "The 1999 Treble: Five games that helped Man Utd win Premier League, FA Cup & Champions League", "content": "Having already clinched the Premier League and FA Cup, Manchester City are one game away from winning the Champions League  and securing the Treble. Only one English team has ever completed the feat before - cross-city rivals  Manchester United in the 1998-99 season. With City boss Pep Guardiola hoping to emulate United manager Sir Alex Ferguson 24 years on, BBC Sport looks at five matches that helped United earn English football's first Treble triumph. Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs produced a moment of magic in extra time  to put the Red Devils into the FA Cup final  at the expense of title rivals Arsenal. After drawing their first semi-final 0-0, both sides were back at Villa Park for a midweek replay full of tension. United took the lead through David Beckham before Dennis Bergkamp levelled in the second half. Any hopes of a Treble quickly began to unravel for United with skipper Roy Keane sent off in the 74th minute and Phil Neville conceding a penalty right at the end of normal time. But Arsenal's own Double hopes were soon extinguished as Bergkamp's penalty was saved by Peter Schmeichel, before Giggs' 109th-minute winner following an incredible mazy run. The Gunners were silenced. The Treble was on. A week later United set up their second final in equally thrilling fashion. Ferguson's side were held 1-1 by Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at Old Trafford, and quickly found themselves 2-0 down in Turin after two Filippo Inzaghi goals in the first 11 minutes. Up stepped captain Keane, who produced one of the greatest individual performances in United's history. The Irishman headed home a David Beckham corner in the 24th minute to inspire a comeback.  Dwight Yorke levelled the tie 10 minutes later and, with United already heading through on away goals,  Andy Cole scored a third in the closing stages . The only blot on United's record were yellow cards for Keane and Paul Scholes, meaning both would miss the final in Barcelona a month later. The march continued. Manchester United secured their fifth Premier League title in seven years  with victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford  on a nerve-shredding final day of the season. United were a point above second-placed Arsenal, knowing a win at home to mid-table Spurs would be enough to be crowned champions. The visitors took a shock lead through Les Ferdinand in the 24th minute, but the Red Devils levelled just before half-time with a curling effort from Beckham. Cole scored the winner two minutes after the restart, lobbing goalkeeper Ian Walker with a sublime finish. United held on to claim their first title on home soil since the days of Sir Matt Busby. Trophy number one of three had been secured. The following weekend Manchester United dominated Newcastle United in the FA Cup final  to secure their third league and cup double of the 1990s . Four days before the Champions League final Ferguson's side strolled to their 10th FA Cup crown thanks to goals from substitute Teddy Sheringham and Scholes at Wembley. Sheringham replaced the injured Keane in the first half and put United in front after 11 minutes following a delightful one-two with Scholes. The England midfielder settled the final seven minutes into the second half with a tidy, drilled finish. Newcastle did not offer much in reply and, after winning trophy number two,  United quickly turned their attention to Barcelona . Late in May 1999 Manchester United reached the promised land. With the Premier League and FA Cup already secured, United  completed their unprecedented Treble  with a scarcely believable win over German giants Bayern Munich in the Champions League final at the Nou Camp. Missing the suspended Keane and Scholes, United fell behind in the sixth minute to Mario Basler's free-kick. Bayern, Treble-chasers themselves, were the better side on the night, hitting the crossbar and the post in the second half but they were unable to finish off United. And it was two substitutes who punished them late on as Sheringham helped on Giggs' scuffed shot to equalise in the 91st minute. Two minutes later Ole Gunnar Solskjaer poked home a second to give manager Ferguson his first Champions League trophy - in 'Fergie time'. Tense and terrific until the very last moment, it is now City's turn to attempt to match the greatest achievement of their fiercest rivals.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65839378"},

{"title": "Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan: 'Pep Guardiola's side finally conquer Champions League mountain'", "content": "2821 The clock was ticking towards midnight in Istanbul when the moment Manchester City craved finally arrived and this sprawling old metropolis on the banks of the Bosphorus could turn sky blue.  Manchester City have taken a scenic and often desperately painful route to winning the Champions League but the journey reached its destination at last as they were finally able to get their hands on the giant trophy  with victory over Inter Milan. The win also completed the Treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup for Pep Guardiola and his side, joining arch-rivals Manchester United as the only English club to achieve the feat.  For Guardiola, who paced and pawed at the giant technical areas of Ataturk Stadium in agitation throughout an attritional encounter, this was his legacy sealed, his place among the game's greats secured by Rodri's 68th-minute winner.  He knew there would always be an unspoken question mark about his time as Manchester City manager until the Champions League was won.  The judgement on his work would always be framed, unfairly or otherwise, around whether he could add to his two victories with Barcelona in this competition - the last in 2011.  The judgement can now be made. No further doubt can be cast on Guardiola's greatness.   A final shrill blast of Polish referee Szymon Marciniak's whistle will have sounded like the sweetest symphony to Guardiola and Manchester City's players. This was what they had worked and - make no mistake - suffered for.  In his moment of triumph, Guardiola reacted with relative calm as he turned to make the long walk down the touchline, offering words of consolation to his Inter opposite number Simone Inzaghi.  And watching on high in Istanbul was Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour, attending only his second game since the club's Abu Dhabi owners took control in 2008.  Clad in a Manchester City scarf, he smiled benignly as he watched the fruits of his fortune achieve the ultimate victory. Not a bad night for only your second game.  This is where the arguments about City take a different course.  No-one can escape the simple fact they are currently facing Premier League charges of 115 breaches of financial rules that many believe sully their glories. It will certainly enter the debate in coming days but it must also be stated that City deny the charges and will defend themselves strenuously.  Amid the golden glitter that soared into the Turkish sky as Ilkay Gundogan held the silver trophy aloft, there was a glorious release, an emotional exchange between Guardiola, City's players and fans - many of whom will remember the misery of long ago when this club spent a season in English football's third tier in 1998-99 but still drew average attendances of almost 30,000 at Maine Road.  Tears were shed as the realisation hit home that the day they longed for had finally arrived, that the Champions League pain was finally over. The mountain Manchester City have struggled to conquer had been climbed. No wonder grown supporters and plenty of players cried.  Kevin de Bruyne, who saw a second Champions League final cut cruelly short by injury, accepted this tournament had become both a dream and an obsession.  The dream had been fulfilled.  The obsession had disappeared.  Just in the last two seasons, City's capacity for inflicting pain on themselves in the Champions League was illustrated in microcosm - by the loss to English rivals Chelsea in the 2021 final, then when defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory in a madcap semi-final second leg against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu last year. There was a tinge of irony in Rodri emerging as City's match-winner because one of the major debates after the disappointing loss to Chelsea in Porto was Guardiola's mystifying decision to exclude his midfield powerhouse. No such mistake this time.  This, in many respects, is the end game of phase one in City's assault on football's European peak. Now the Champions League itch has been scratched they will surely be favourites for next season's competition, indeed favourites once more for the three trophies they have won this campaign.  Guardiola looked drained as City's players celebrated wildly around him. That was understandable because it will mean so much to him.  He has won five Premier League titles in six years and dominated domestically but this makes his work complete, for now. This driven, intense perfectionist will want to do it all again, and better next season.  This was the trophy Guardiola was brought to Manchester City to win. They had won league titles under Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini before him. His mission was to win the Champions League, hence that lingering - and in reality nonsensical - debate about his time at Etihad Stadium.  The arrival of his former Barcelona cohorts Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain as CEO and director of football respectively was almost an act of getting the City house in order to welcome its most important tenant, namely Guardiola.  On this sultry night in Istanbul, he delivered his mission statement.  Manchester City were once dubbed \"the noisy neighbours\" by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. It was not a compliment nor was it intended as one.  They were certainly deafening as they poured out of Ataturk Stadium into the choking traffic and vast sprawl of Istanbul to celebrate City's greatest night at the end of their greatest season.  They have won seven Premier League titles, three FA Cups and six League Cups since they came under Abu Dhabi control.  But the Champions League was the one they always wanted, the one they had eyes on since the day in September 2008 that changed the face of English football.  It has taken time but Manchester City have now finally changed the face of European football and this could be the start of an era of Champions League domination.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65869278"},
{"title": "Man City beat Inter Milan 1-0 in Champions League final to claim Treble", "content": "5600 Manchester City's long quest to win the Champions League finally ended in triumph against Inter Milan in Istanbul as Pep Guardiola's side completed the Treble.  After winning the Premier League and FA Cup, City emulated Manchester United's triple trophy haul in 1999 as they became only the second English club to achieve the feat after Rodri's crisp 68th-minute strike settled an attritional final.  Guardiola's all-conquering side were never at their best against a brilliantly organised Inter and had to cope with the loss of Kevin de Bruyne to injury in the first half. But the massed ranks of City fans inside Ataturk Stadium did not care about that as they joyously celebrated the greatest night - and season - in the club's history.  And for Guardiola, it seals his status as one of the managerial greats as he added a third Champions League to the two he won at Barcelona, the last coming in 2011.  This was never the walkover many predicted and City had to survive a few scares when Federico Dimarco's header bounced off the bar and Ederson made a stunning late save to deny Romelu Lukaku but ultimately this was all about the victory.  Now Guardiola and his players can take their place in history.  The Champions League has brought suffering to City and Guardiola - especially when they lost to Premier League rivals Chelsea in the 2021 final - but all the pain disappeared just before midnight on a sultry night in Istanbul.  City survived late anxiety, especially when Inter substitute Lukaku headed straight at Ederson with the goal at his mercy, but there was an explosion of joy on the pitch and in the stands at Ataturk Stadium as they finally secured the giant trophy that has remained so elusively beyond their grasp for so long.  Guardiola said, whether it was fair or not, that his time at Manchester City would be judged on whether he was able to bring the Champions League to the club. Now that judgement can be made.  The Catalan, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, will now be an iconic figure at City as well as Barcelona.  It is a simple fact that many outside the Abu Dhabi-owned club will always view their triumph through the prism of the  charges of 115 financial breaches  brought against them by the Premier League, charges they fiercely deny.  For City's owners, with Sheikh Mansour attending only his second game since taking control in 2008, this was the night they have planned for and the one when they finally claimed that holy grail.  This was an evening when only the result mattered to City, not the manner in which their greatest victory was achieved.  This was not a win secured with the dazzling style and creation that is usually their hallmark. In fact for long periods it was a scrappy, sloppy performance in the face of a well-drilled Inter side who were right in this Champions League Final until the whistle went.  None of that will matter now. All that will be recalled forever about this game by City's fans was the moment when Rodri arrived on the end of build-up play from Manuel Akanji and Bernardo Silva to send that precise right-foot finish away from the reach of Inter's outstanding keeper Andre Onana.  And of course the triumphant Champions League trophy lift. City lived dangerously in the closing minutes and, when it was all over, Guardiola, so agitated in his technical area, was relatively calm as he sought out opposite number Simone Inzaghi for consoling words.  John Stones was once again outstanding for City while keeper Ederson made key contributions when required.  The celebrations at the final whistle reflected a magnificent season as City finally got their hands on the Champions League trophy and prepared to parade it around the streets of Manchester along with the Premier League and FA Cup on Monday.

{"title": "Real Madrid 1-1 Man City: Jack Grealish says City are 'unstoppable' at home but who will win?", "content": "1265 Jack Grealish says Manchester City will feel \"unstoppable\" when they host Real Madrid in a finely balanced second leg of their Champions League semi-final next Wednesday. Kevin de Bruyne's second-half effort cancelled out Vinicius Jr's opener for 14-time winners Real, to earn  City a 1-1 draw  at the Bernabeu, on Tuesday.  Real scored twice in added time before dramatically triumphing against City in Spain at the same stage last term \"We've learned so much since last year,\" Grealish told BT Sport. \"We have a new team this year, different players. It's a year ago. We have the perfect balance of experience and world-class youngsters. I've never felt so confident going onto the pitch having the players around me.\" City were two goals ahead on aggregate going into the 90th minute of their second leg against Real last term but collapsed in remarkable fashion.   Rodrygo scored twice in added time and Karim Benzema then converted an extra-time penalty to see the Spanish side advance 6-5 on aggregate. However, with this year's tie set to be concluded on City's home patch, where they have won 14 consecutive matches by a combined score of 49-7, the odds feel firmly stacked in favour of Pep Guardiola's Treble-chasing side. \"At the Etihad, we feel unstoppable,\" added City forward Grealish.  \"We came here to try to win, but it shows our character to go a goal down in a place like this. In the end I think it was a fair result. They had their chances, we had a few.\" In the opposing camp, however, Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois says the defending champions cannot be discounted.  They have already convincingly beaten Liverpool and Chelsea away from home in this season's competition. \"Next week will be like a final, and we are quite good at winning finals,\" said the Belgian. \"Hopefully we can mentalise it like that even though it is at City and it will be tough for us.\" City's previous European knockout ties to end in 1-1 away draws in the first leg both saw them progress to the next round.  Meanwhile, Real have progressed from just two of their nine Champions League knockout stage ties when failing to win the first leg at home - both of these were against Manchester United (1999-00 and 2012-13). Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former Marseille and England winger Chris Waddle said he was struggling to identify a clear favourite. \"It's a positive result for Man City. But is it a great result? Will Real Madrid enjoy going to the Etihad with nothing to lose?\" said Waddle. \"Manchester City controlled large parts of this game. I think they could have been a little bit more positive in the final third and I think they could have come away with a better result than this. \"Real Madrid know how to manage games and you've got to say some of their football was great on the eye at times.\" Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon added: \"I think Pep Guardiola will be delighted with the result and the performance. Everyone expects City to win these games 2-0 and 3-0 but it's just not reality because they are playing against a top top team.\" While the pundits expect a close encounter when Madrid travel to Manchester on Wednesday, 17 May (20:00 BST), the social reaction sways well towards the home side: Man City didn't have much excuse for not winning the Champions League even before tonight but now they've got a draw away to Real Madrid they have no excuse at all and should definitely win it. Surely they can't bottle it this time…  Looks like its an advantage to City in Etihad. But don't forget what happened last season in 10 minutes. How is this a good result for City when we there is no away goals? All Real Madrid have to do is play counter or hold on for a 0-0 and lottery of a penalty shootout. Manchester City have NEVER lost a European tie after drawing the first leg away (won 8 out of 8).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65540808"},

{"title": "AC Milan 0-2 Inter Milan: Edin Dzeko scores as Inter beat city rivals in thrilling derby", "content": "392 Inter Milan took a big step towards reaching the Champions League final as they beat their city rivals in a thrilling Milan derby at San Siro. In a game that had been anticipated for weeks in Italy and was witnessed at the ground by a vocal and passionate 80,000-strong crowd, Inter made the perfect start when Edin Dzeko volleyed home in the eighth minute. The goal silenced the Milan fans - the designated home side for this tie in the stadium the two sides share - as they significantly outnumbered the Inter supporters. And the hosts were stunned further three minutes later when Henrikh Mkhitaryan swept a shot beyond Mike Maignan after being set up by Federico Dimarco. Hakan Calhanoglu hit the woodwork as Inter threatened to get a third, but there was hope for AC Milan when referee Jesus Gil Manzano reversed a decision to award the visitors a penalty, deeming Lautaro Martinez to have dived after consulting the pitchside monitor. Inter dropped their tempo in the second half as they looked to protect their two-goal advantage and it almost presented AC Milan with a lifeline as Sandro Tonali struck the post with a shot from the edge of the box. But Inter held firm and are in a strong position to reach the final - where they will face either Manchester City or Real Madrid - when the two sides meet again at San Siro for the second leg on Tuesday, 16 May (20:00 BST). Inter Milan are three times winners of the European Cup or Champions League, but have not reached the final since they last lifted the trophy 13 years ago. This is the furthest they have been in the competition since then and, despite the intimidating atmosphere created by the overwhelming number of AC Milan fans, they were determined to push on. Inter boss Simone Inzaghi opted for the 37-year-old Dzeko to lead the attack, with Romelu Lukaku on the bench, and it didn't take long for that decision to be vindicated as the former Manchester City striker steered home a brilliant finish from a corner. AC Milan knocked Tottenham and Serie A champions Napoli out of the Champions League on their way to the semi-finals but looked capable of being opened up by Inter with every attack and would have been pleased to reach half time just 2-0 down. They were better after the break but did not manage a shot on target until the 81st minute - a deflected Junior Messias effort - and will need to be much, much better if they are to deny Inter a place in the Champions League final.

The elegant Portuguese shouldering the weight of his grizzled opponent's elbow.  Tranquillity amid the chaos as a pair of footballing rivals paused to ponder a hazy wall of red smoke and simmering flares. \"Everyone was focused on the flares, on the smoke,\" photographer Stefano Rellandini, who captured that iconic image 18 years ago, tells BBC Sport. \"But near the centre of the pitch I saw a certain moment. \"Materazzi was nicknamed something like a butcher; he is not really a gentle player. Rui Costa was the opposite - more gentle, more artistic in his football. For several seconds Materazzi put his elbow on the shoulder of Rui Costa. \"So when I saw that, I shot it. I have just one frame in that sequence. That was the moment.\" The picture has its own legacy, but it also captured the end of AC Milan and Inter Milan's most recent Champions League match; a 2005 quarter-final that was abandoned after flares and other objects rained down on the San Siro turf from a section of Inter fans, one striking and injuring Milan goalkeeper Dida. With 73 minutes played of the second leg, the referee abandoned the match and the tie was later awarded to Milan, who were leading 3-0 on aggregate. \"The atmosphere that night was like every time you have an AC Milan and Inter derby at the San Siro,\" says Rellandini, who was working for Reuters at the time. \"It is always strong. They don't fight a lot, but the choreography of the supporters is huge and great, so you can really feel it, even if you're not a player.  \"When you put your feet on to the pitch, you can feel that it's not just a soccer match. It is something more. \"You are really close to the players. It was a nice atmosphere; there was adrenaline.  \"It just blew up when they disallowed the goal from Esteban Cambiasso. That completely changed the situation. \"The Inter Milan supporters were freaking out. They started throwing down objects, flares, and did not stop for about 15 or 20 minutes. It was something like a war.\" The tension had been brewing. Milan had knocked Inter out of the competition two years earlier on away goals, despite both semi-final legs ending in a draw at the San Siro. Milan went on to beat Juventus on penalties in the final at Old Trafford. Milan also headed into the 2004-05 campaign as Italian champions - a sixth Scudetto since Inter last got their hands on the Serie A title in 1988-89. Owner Silvio Berlusconi was building his second truly great Milan side and the entrepreneur-turned-politician had trusted Carlo Ancelotti, a member of the team that won successive European Cups in 1989 and 1990, to deliver another period of success as manager. For the quarter-final second leg a formidable back four of Cafu, Jaap Stam, Alessandro Nesta and Paolo Maldini sat behind Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini and Kaka, with Hernan Crespo - formerly of Inter - and Andriy Shevchenko up front. Rui Costa was on the bench. Inter, meanwhile, had spent lavishly to try and compete with Milan and Juventus. Chairman Massimo Moratti broke the transfer world record twice in three years, first to sign Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and then to get Christian Vieri from Lazio in 1999. Crespo and Seedorf had arrived at Inter on big deals, but failed to land any significant silverware, before uniting across the divide at Milan. Fabio Cannavaro had also come and gone - a misfiring two-year spell ending with a move to Juventus. By 2005 the Inter midfield was built around the Argentina pair of Cambiasso and Juan Sebastian Veron, while ahead of them precocious Brazil forward Adriano was enjoying his most prolific season in a black and blue shirt. The team were improving. The results weren't. Inter carried the unwanted tag of 'August champions' among rival fans, who mocked the expectations that had been built up in the summer transfer market and invariably fizzled out by the time silverware was at stake in May. Among Inter supporters, there was an underlying feeling that they were running an unfair race - between them, Milan and Juventus had won 11 of the previous 13 titles. However, in 2006 both would be implicated in the  Calciopoli scandal.  Juventus were relegated to Serie B for their part and stripped of two titles. Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio and Reggina were docked points. In 2005 rumours were already swirling in the stands. Criminal investigations had begun in Naples and Turin over alleged bribery and corruption in football. As the match turned against Inter, their fans' frustrations - at the scoreline and their inability to close the gap on Milan and Juventus teams who always seemed one step ahead - spilled over from the stands and on to the pitch. Stam and Shevchenko had given Milan a two-goal advantage in the first leg. But heading into their 'home' leg at the San Siro, Inter's fans were still buoyant and hopeful of a comeback. Milan great Alessandro Costacurta, who came on as a substitute in the first leg, talked of the 'Derby della Madonnina' meetings as the \"worst\" days in his career. He couldn't sleep. \"It was the turmoil of emotions,\" he said. \"It was the tension.\" Team-mate Maldini described an \"electricity\" across the city. Shevchenko also said he struggled to sleep and remembers seeing more club colours on show around the city as the games grew closer. \"There was great tension, great anticipation but above all passion, and always with civil attitudes,\" the former Ukraine forward told Gazzetta dello Sport recently. It was Shevchenko, Milan's number seven, who opened the scoring half an hour into a fiery second leg when he beat Francesco Toldo with a left-footed effort from outside the box. That the forward had avoided punishment after appearing to headbutt Materazzi early on only added to Inter's fury, with fans also believing they should have had a penalty. But the real flashpoint came with just under 20 minutes remaining. Inter midfielder Cambiasso's bald head met Veron's corner to seemingly make it 3-1 on aggregate, only for the goal to be disallowed because striker Julio Cruz was ruled to have fouled Dida. There looked to be little contact. Flares thrown by the ultras in the Curva Nord began to pour down on the San Siro turf like flaming arrows.  One struck Dida on the shoulder, narrowly missing his head, as he attempted to clear the pyrotechnics and bottles from his penalty area. The players gathered in the centre of the pitch as Maldini, Cambiasso and Inter captain Javier Zanetti remonstrated with referee Markus Merk, before Zanetti and Veron took to helping the firefighters who were dousing the flames by trying to clear debris from the goalmouth.  Eventually, with objects still cascading down from the stands, both teams were ordered off the pitch, attempting to shelter as they escaped via a tunnel in the same corner of the ground as the ultras. \"After the first few flares lit up, the pitch was completely in the fog, so you couldn't see. Even if you wanted to catch a picture of someone injured, you couldn't,\" explains Rellandini, although he did manage to catch his masterpiece amid the chaos. \"They stopped the match for almost half an hour, which was strange at that time. You start to think that something bad has happened because they really threw down everything - they were getting crazy.\" When the players returned, Dida - treated for first-degree burns to his shoulder - was replaced by Christian Abbiati, but after 30 seconds, with the barrage continuing, Merk was forced to abandon the fixture. \"The referee took the right decision,\" said Maldini. \"I was surprised that he tried to restart the game but it was good because so many supporters had paid to watch.\" Ancelotti, like Inter manager Roberto Mancini, condemned the incident, calling it a \"disgraceful episode\". \"What happened will not just discredit Inter but all of the city,\" Ancelotti said. \"The reaction of the Inter fans was completely unexpected. I was really surprised because I have never seen something like that in all of the Milan derbies that I have taken part in.\" Milan police chief Paolo Scarpi blamed it on \"two to three hundred hooligans… the usual hotheads from the Inter section\", while Berlusconi, Italian prime minister at the time as well as Milan owner, suggested \"drastic measures\" were needed to stem the rise of violence at stadiums. Uefa, European football's governing body,  handed Inter a £132,000 fine  and ordered them to play four European games behind closed doors. \"This is the largest fine in Uefa's history. There will be some people who think it is lenient and some people who think it harsh,\" a Uefa spokesperson told the BBC. Milan went on to beat PSV Eindhoven on away goals in the semi-finals - Dida set a Champions League record of seven successive clean sheets in their 2-0 first-leg victory, before PSV won the return 3-1. Milan would have clinched a seventh European title but for a  miracle in Istanbul  in which Liverpool scored three times in six minutes in the final before winning on penalties. Milan would get their revenge two years later, seeing off Liverpool in the final in Athens, although on a domestic level their points deduction and Juventus' relegation opened the door for a period of Inter dominance in Serie A. Inter were awarded the 2006 title then won four in a row, culminating in a Treble under Jose Mourinho in 2009-10. Neither Milan side have reached the final since, but that will change this year after a semi-final derby that has also brought Rellandini's iconic image back to life.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65494105"},
{"title": "AC Milan 0-2 Inter Milan: 'Worse than AC Milan's wildest dreams' but will Inter have 'big regrets'?", "content": "For one team, it was a nightmare start. After weeks of hype about the first Milan derby in the Champions League since 2005, AC Milan trailed 2-0 inside 11 minutes. This had not been the plan. Before kick-off, the 'home' supporters - both legs will be played at San Siro - unfurled a giant display of a devil's face, along with the words: \"Hell is empty, all the devils are here!\" But it was quickly heaven for Inter fans, thanks to goals for Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. \"Everything that could have gone wrong for Milan has done,\" said former AC Milan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at half-time. \"It is an absolute disaster and one in their wildest dreams they could not have imagined.\" Former England and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said on BT Sport: \"That performance from AC Milan is so far away from semi-final level at this Champions League, it was frightening.\" However, after a  host of missed Inter Milan chances  and a controversial video assistant referee decision, have AC Milan been handed a lifeline they didn't deserve? A Milan derby is always a memorable occasion but one in a European competition is something to savour. Only twice before Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg had AC Milan faced their fierce city rivals Inter on the continental stage and both sets of supporters were determined to make the most of it. AC Milan, the designated home team at the San Siro stadium the two sides share, had by far the greater number of fans inside. A wall of noise, red smoke flares and large banners made for an intimidating atmosphere. But it was the away side who came out swinging. After racing into a two-goal lead, they also hit the woodwork through Hakan Calhanoglu as AC Milan were left exposed time and time again. Inter even had a first-half penalty awarded to them for a foul on Lautaro Martinez before the decision was controversially overturned following a VAR review. Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi said: \"We played a brilliant first half, but it's a tight scoreline for what we did out there. \"It's a hugely positive night which gives us a lot of satisfaction but we're missing one more piece to attain a dream that we believed in since August.\" Former Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said on BT Sport: \"I found it bizarre for AC Milan to be so passive. Inter could have been out of sight. The best thing to come out of tonight's performance for AC Milan is it's only 2-0. Defensively they were all over the place.\" Ex-Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"Inter came out like a bunch of sprinters at the Olympics and AC Milan had stage fright.\" The big decision came in the 31st minute. Inter were awarded a penalty as Martinez went down inside the box following a Simon Kjaer challenge. But when referee Jesus Gil Manzano was urged to check the pitchside monitor by VAR, the decision was overturned. Manzano did not feel there was enough contact from Kjaer, who had grabbed Martinez's shirt before he went down. \"He absolutely tried to con the referee. He felt a hand on his waist and threw himself down,\" said BBC Radio 5 Live pundit and former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin. \"I am delighted the referee changed his mind.\" But others were not so sure. \"I think there is contact so I am surprised they overturned it,\" former Manchester United and Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves told BT Sport.  \"It is a penalty. He gets clipped and had an arm around him. If he feels something, he is going to go down. \"Inter Milan were brilliant but with the penalty and missed chances, there will also be big regrets.\" Gerrard added: \"I think he kills himself by the reaction. I think technically the penalty should have stood. The ref looks and thinks the contact is not enough for the reaction. He goes to the screen and sees it is minimal contact.\" Inzaghi put his faith in experience and it paid off as 37-year-old Dzeko got the opener after eight minutes before 34-year-old Mkhitaryan got the second. It was the first time two players aged 34 or above have scored for a team in a Champions League knockout match. \"Dzeko is a world-class player,\" said Begovic, who played alongside Dzeko for Bosnia-Herzegovina. \"It is no surprise to me he is doing this, having known him for 15 years. He has hold-up play, technique, maybe lacking a bit of pace.  \"He is dedicated to the game, disciplined, looks after himself immaculately. He leads the front line perfectly.\" Only one team in Champions League semi-final history have won the first leg by two or more goals and not reached the final - Barcelona, who lost a 3-0 lead against Liverpool in 2018-19. But, despite the two-goal advantage, Inter know their place in a first Champions League final since 2010 is not booked yet.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65553144"},
{"title": "Man City v Real Madrid: 'Kevin de Bruyne still needs his legacy moment'", "content": "Kevin de Bruyne's stunning goal helped Manchester City get a draw from their Champions League first leg against Real Madrid - but does he get the credit he deserves? Vinicius Jr crashed Real into the lead  at the Bernabeu last week , with De Bruyne's 25-yard strike levelling the semi-final going into Wednesday's second leg at Etihad Stadium. The Belgium midfielder has been consistently one of the best players in Europe since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015. The 31-year-old has scored 64 goals and made 101 assists in 237 Premier League games for City. Only Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller have made more assists across Europe's top five leagues in that time. \"I think De Bruyne still needs a defining moment on this stage,\" said journalist James Horncastle on BBC Radio 5 Live's  Euro Leagues Show . \"As big as City are in the Premier League and as much as Pep Guardiola brings the world's attention on City, they are not a legacy club.  \"It is harder for a City player to create consensus around football journalists. A lot of time the genius and style of play is associated with Guardiola.\" De Bruyne has scored 14 Champions League goals for City, with a club record 11 of them coming in knockout games. French journalist Julien Laurens said: \"City needed De Bruyne to step up in the second half because he was quite neutral in the first half. \"He just popped up in a moment that maybe could take his team to another final.  \"Real Madrid were set up to prevent De Bruyne from having a big impact on the game. Yet he stays in the game because at some point he knows something will come to him. \"Mentally you have to be very strong to stay in your game until that moment and I think his celebration showed it. He ran to the corner where the City fans were and he clearly exploded. This is what big players do.\" De Bruyne has been named Premier League player of the season twice and finished third in the 2022 Ballon d'Or. City team-mate Erling Haaland was recently named the Football Writers' Association (FWA) footballer of the year. Spanish journalist Guillem Balague said: \"I voted for De Bruyne as player of the year. But it is difficult to pick him. It doesn't come natural to say De Bruyne, the best player of Manchester City and the Premier League. \"In Spain he is seen as good but not as in Real Madrid and Barcelona should be fighting for him. That's partly because we have had a few like De Bruyne in recent years and secondly because his manager is a work of art at City, playing the best football we've seen but it is not down to one player doing marvellous things in different parts of the pitch.  \"They all have their square of influence and Kevin de Bruyne has not been allowed to come out of that. In that area of influence he is very good but not in the kind of amazing way where we say he has to be given the Ballon d'Or.\" Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr, who scored the opener in the first leg, has become one of Europe's best players in the last few seasons. This season alone the 22-year-old Brazilian has scored 23 goals and assisted another 21. A winger with remarkable dribbling ability, his strike last week was a brilliant hit from 25 yards. Laurens said: \"If he starts scoring goals like that on top of everything else he does really well then he becomes an even bigger problem for all the teams that will face him. \"It was fantastic and maybe it is the next evolution for him on how he improves even more.\"  Only Haaland (13 - 12 goals, one assist) has been involved in more Champions League goals than Vinicius this season (12 - seven goals, five assists). Balague said: \"If he does what he is doing so far with 20-odd assists this season and more goals than he has ever scored in a season it is fine.  \"If he can intervene and be influential in different parts of the pitch it takes him to being the best in the world. \"But he has to do it for a few full seasons.\" When Vinicius first joined Real from Flamengo in 2018, he had bags of skill but his finishing let him down. In his first three seasons he hit a combined 14 goals in all competitions, but he has netted 55 in almost two seasons since. Horncastle said: \"One of the things that should never go under the radar with Vinicius is the chance that Real Madrid took on him.  \"They spent a lot of money when they signed him - more than £40m - when nobody had heard of him and they signed him straight from Brazil and over time they have developed him and we are talking now about a player who is top three in the world.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65571486"},

Arsenal's 1-0 defeat  by Nottingham Forest on Saturday  means City are champions for a fifth time in six years and now have the chance to win an historic Treble. Pep Guardiola's side play Manchester United in the FA Cup final on 3 June, before facing Inter Milan a week later in Istanbul, where they will seek their first Champions League triumph. \"They will be talked about for years to come if they can get the Treble,\" Shearer said. \"It's remarkable, what an opportunity for them. They are two games away from immortality.\" Manchester United were the last side to win five Premier League titles in six seasons, between 1996 and 2001 - including the Treble of league, FA Cup and Champions League in 1999. United also won seven titles in nine seasons between 1993-2001, as well as five titles in seven seasons between 2007-2013. Before that, Liverpool in the late 1970s and early '80s enjoyed similar spells of consecutive league titles. Former City keeper Shay Given believes Guardiola's current side are stronger than ever. \"They are incredible,\" Given said. \"There are even unsung heroes like John Stones, be it at right-back, centre-back or in midfield. \"At times against Real Madrid in midweek he was the spare man on the edge of the box. He was signed as a centre-half and he is playing a key role in this team. \"I can't see a weakness. De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez. There are star men all over the pitch.\" Striker Erling Haaland's remarkable haul of 52 goals in 48 games in all competitions - including a record-breaking 36 goals in 33 league appearances - has added even more cutting edge to the side.  Shearer believes the former Borussia Dortmund forward can unlock City's maiden Champions League win. \"The reason Erling Haaland was bought was to put City in this position,\" Shearer said. \"They've got one trophy in the bag, and they've got two other finals. He was brought in to win them the Champions League, he lives for goals, that is what his life is about.  \"I love his attitude, you can tell that he is so hungry, and how much a goal means to him, and I admire that so much.\" City could yet win the Premier League by 13 points after powering clear following a classic duel with Arsenal and will start as favourites in both remaining cup finals. Where they rank in history remains up for debate but former Premier League striker Glenn Murray believes they are a better team than Sir Alex Ferguson's 1999 Treble winners. \"Yes they are better,\" Murray said. \"And I say that reluctantly as I was United fan as a kid - I looked up to that generation and it seems that feat would never be repeated. \"But this City team are deadly. They beat people and move on. They are an emotionless winning machine. Nothing bothers them. \"Do we have them as one of the top club sides ever? If they add this Champions League and possibly this Treble then they are in the debate alongside the likes of Pep's Barcelona.\" City were charged in February by the Premier League with more than 100 breaches of its financial rules following a four-year investigation.  The charges cover the period of 2009-2018, since the 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by billionaire Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family. They are accused of effectively falsifying their accounts and artificially inflating sponsorship and commercial deals over a number of years to allow them to spend more but stay within Uefa and Premier League rules. City said they were \"surprised by the charges\" but welcomed the \"review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider\" their case, which the club said was supported by a \"comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\". City, who have always denied financial wrongdoing, said they \"look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all\". The club has been referred to an independent commission, which can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League. It is not known how long the process will take.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65660666"},
{"title": "Inter Milan 1-0 AC Milan (3-0 agg): Inter reach Champions League final for first time in 13 years", "content": "386 Inter Milan reached the Champions League final for the first time in 13 years as Lautaro Martinez's goal sealed victory over fierce rivals AC Milan at San Siro. Three-time winners Inter, who led 2-0 after the first leg, will face either Manchester City or Real Madrid in Istanbul on 10 June after a disciplined second-leg display ensured their progress. Heavily backed at a feverish San Siro as the designated home team, Inter were made to absorb early pressure as a determined start by Milan ensured the match began at a frenetic pace. Theo Hernandez fired marginally over with a ferocious strike and Brahim Diaz was denied by Andre Onana as Stefano Pioli's side attempted to undo the damage done by conceding two goals inside 11 minutes last week. The talented Rafael Leao, absent for Milan in the first leg because of a thigh injury, displayed flashes of inspiration on his return but shot agonisingly wide of the far post after driving in from the left. Inter asserted themselves as the first half progressed and the tie would have been effectively over before the interval had it not been for Mike Maignan's stunning reaction save from Edin Dzeko's close-range header. Inter had starved Milan of encouragement in a largely uneventful second half, before Martinez squeezed the ball under Maignan and into the bottom corner with 16 minutes remaining to send the Inter fans into raptures. The full-time whistle was greeted by a deafening noise as Inter's first shot at Champions League glory since their 2010 success was confirmed. Simone Inzaghi was happy to accept that Tuesday's second leg represented \"one of the most important games in Inter's history\" and the Italian showed faith in the same 11 that arguably should have ended the tie as a contest a week earlier. He and his players would have expected a different match - including an intense start from their historic rivals - as they returned in front of a feverish 80,000-strong San Siro crowd to play out the conclusion of the first Milan derby in European competition for 20 years. That was exactly what they faced as seven-time winners Milan pressed for an early goal in an attempt to ignite a memorable comeback, with Diaz and Leao both going agonisingly close. However, they had to rely on goalkeeper Maignan to keep alive their hopes at the other end of the pitch, with the alert France international also producing a superb stop to deny Nicolo Barella before seeing the offside flag raised. But any hopes of a late fightback were extinguished by Martinez's well-taken finish and, for just the second time ever, the Inter supporters were able to enjoy a fourth win over Milan in a single season, as their side comfortably managed the closing stages. Inter will go into the final against Real Madrid or Manchester City as underdogs, and they will require a near-perfect performance to overcome either. But Inzaghi's side will be quietly confident of causing an upset, having not trailed in any knockout-stage match in this season's Champions League and keeping a competition-leading eight clean sheets. The 2023 Champions League final, featuring Inter Milan and either Manchester City or Real Madrid, will take place in Istanbul, Turkey on 10 June at 20:00 BST.

{"title": "Bayern Munich v Man City: The greatest comebacks in Champions League history", "content": "Manchester City head to Bayern Munich on Wednesday with a Champions League semi-final spot firmly in their grasp. Bayern host the Premier League champions needing to overturn a three-goal deficit - something only achieved on three previous occasions in the competition - after losing the quarter-final first leg 3-0 at Etihad Stadium. But history shows the improbable is not impossible. Before Bayern look to upset the odds, we revisit some of the greatest comebacks in Champions League history. Tottenham travelled to Ajax for the second leg of their semi-final trailing 1-0, and things went from bad to worse in Amsterdam when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech put Ajax 3-0 ahead on aggregate before the break. Spurs needed to score three times without reply to progress, and were given a glimmer of hope 10 minutes into the second half through Lucas Moura - and it was game on just four minutes later.  Moura pounced on a loose ball in the box after Fernando Llorente's shot was saved and he curled home to put the hosts on the ropes. The stunning turnaround was completed in the 95th minute when  Moura completed his hat-trick  to seal Tottenham's spot in the final on away goals, leaving Ajax players strewn across the turf in disbelief. Just 24 hours before Tottenham's heroics in Amsterdam, Liverpool had become just the third club in the history of the Champions League to overturn a three-goal first-leg deficit. The Reds' hopes of forcing their way back into the semi-final after a 3-0 loss to Barcelona at the Nou Camp looked slim, especially with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino unavailable due to injury. But Divock Origi got the ball rolling on seven minutes, before the tie really turned in the space of 166 seconds after half-time when substitute Georginio Wijnaldum scored twice. A moment of quick thinking saw  Liverpool complete the job  as Trent Alexander-Arnold spotted Barcelona's defence switch off from a corner, whipping the ball in low for Origi to fire home and spark wild scenes at Anfield. In a memorable year for English comebacks in the Champions League, it all started with  Manchester United seeing off Paris St-Germain  in the last 16. Interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer suffered the first defeat of his tenure in the first leg when a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford halted an 11-game unbeaten run. None of the previous 107 clubs to lose a Champions League or European Cup first leg by two goals or more at home had managed to advance and few expected United to buck that trend. But Romelu Lukaku got United off to the perfect start after two minutes only for Juan Bernat to hit back 11 minutes later, restoring PSG's two-goal aggregate lead. The Red Devils refused to give up and Lukaku put them ahead on the night before Marcus Rashford converted his first competitive penalty for the club in the 94th minute to send United through. \"Roma have risen from their ruins.\" That iconic line from commentator Peter Drury summed up an incredible night as Roma clinched a  memorable comeback  to send Barcelona packing in the quarter-finals. Own goals from Daniele de Rossi and Kostas Manolas helped Barca record a 4-1 win in the first leg at the Nou Camp. Edin Dzeko's late goal in Spain gave Roma something to build from and the forward struck early in the return leg to further strengthen their belief. De Rossi atoned for his own goal with a second-half strike and, with just eight minutes to go, Manolas headed home a corner to end Roma's 34-year wait for a place in the semi-finals of Europe's leading competition. Arguably the greatest comeback of all, this one is so iconic that it has its very own title in France and Spain -  La Remontada  (the comeback). PSG were clinical at home, winning 4-0, but the Nou Camp sensed something special when Luis Suarez scored after just three minutes in the second leg. Barcelona were two goals to the good at the break courtesy of a Layvin Kurzawa own goal, but still trailed by two goals on aggregate. Lionel Messi scored a penalty soon after the restart but Edinson Cavani hit back to silence the home faithful, although it wasn't the pendulum-swinging moment PSG hoped for. Barcelona, now trailing 5-3, needed three goals in fewer than 30 minutes to achieve a miracle. Neymar scored a free-kick in the 88th minute to offer further hope, before the Brazilian stroked home a 91st-minute penalty to level the tie at 5-5 on aggregate. But PSG were still heading through on away goals. But with 20 seconds of added time remaining, La Remontada came to fruition when Sergi Roberto turned home Neymar's chipped pass, with Barcelona becoming the only team in history to overturn a four-goal Champions League deficit. That famous night in Istanbul. Moving away from two-legged ties, the  2005 Champions League final  was an unforgettable night of football. AC Milan thought they had their hands on the trophy after racing into a 3-0 half-time time, but seven second-half minutes altered the course of history. Steven Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso scored to level the game for Liverpool and that is how it remained after 120 minutes, with Reds keeper Jerzy Dudek making a stunning double save from Andriy Shevchenko in extra-time. Invoking memories of Bruce Grobelaar in 1984, Dudek's wobbly legs and goalline antics played a major part in earning his side victory in the penalty shootout, when Serginho, Andrea Pirlo and Shevchenko failed to convert. Deportivo La Coruna, currently plying their trade in the third tier of Spanish football, are no longer associated with the Champions League - but they carried out an unforgettable fightback against heavyweight opposition in 2004. Milan travelled to Spain with a 4-1 lead from the first leg, but Deportivo were not ready to roll over. Walter Pandiani, who broke the deadlock at the San Siro, got the Spaniards up and running on home soil. Unlike the first leg when they sat back after taking the lead, Deportivo threw caution to the wind and it paid off as they wiped out Milan's aggregate advantage in just 43 minutes. That was enough to go through on away goals but they continued to press and Fran slotted home a fourth to confirm Carlo Ancelotti's side were heading out. It was almost scripted that Manchester United would seal the final piece of their historic Treble in 'Fergie Time'. With the Premier League and FA Cup already secured, United had the small matter of German giants Bayern Munich standing in their way in the  1999 Champions League final  at the Nou Camp. With Roy Keane and Paul Scholes both suspended, United's hopes had already been dealt a blow, and their mission grew even tougher when Mario Basler put Bayern ahead on six minutes. But ultimately the final proved to be a tale of two substitutes - Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Sheringham helped on Ryan Giggs' scuffed shot to level in the 91st minute before Solskjaer poked in the second just two minutes later, handing manager Sir Alex Ferguson his first Champions League trophy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64882764"},
{"title": "Manchester City 4-0 Real Madrid (Agg 5-1): Bernardo Silva scores twice as City reach Champions League final", "content": "4582 Manchester City delivered a relentless performance laced with outstanding quality to overpower holders Real Madrid and reach the Champions League final against Inter Milan in Istanbul.  City have lost two previous semi-finals to Real but they made no mistake here at a joyous Etihad Stadium to now stand one step away from claiming the trophy that has always stayed tantalisingly out of reach for Pep Guardiola's team.  And their display in a magical first half, in particular, will live long in the memory as the masters of this tournament were left bewildered by City's brilliance. It maintained a seemingly unstoppable march towards a treble of Champions League, Premier League - which can be won with victory at home to Chelsea on Sunday - and the FA Cup, where they play Manchester United in the final at Wembley.  Real keeper Thibaut Courtois performed heroics to save two Erling Haaland headers early in the first half but he was powerless to stop Bernardo Silva's close-range finish after 23 minutes, the Portugal midfielder scoring a looping header for the second eight minutes before half-time.  City faced the occasional threats from Real after the break, Ederson saving well from David Alaba and Karim Benzema, but they were no match and when Manuel Akanji's header deflected in off Eder Militao 14 minutes from time the celebrations started.  Substitute Julian Alvarez then wrapped up the dominant win with a late strike after latching onto a brilliant Phil Foden pass. City will play Inter on 10 June as they look to win the Champions League for the first time. City have put themselves in a magnificent position to become only the second English club to win the Treble first claimed by Manchester United in 1999.  City look to have finally broken Arsenal in the Premier League title race and will be overwhelming favourites to beat Inter Milan, although the desire to keep this feat for themselves will provide fuel and inspiration for United in the FA Cup final at Wembley.  Guardiola's side have somehow found ways to miss out on the Champions League in the past but the addition of Haaland's sheer menace as well as more defensive steel makes it difficult to see how they will not find a way past surprise finalists Inter.  City made a Real side full of experience and quality look several classes beneath them in a first half that will be among the finest this stadium has seen, the dazzling interplay, fierce intensity and pace giving them a two-goal advantage that would have been far more but for the excellence of Courtois.  This night had a special atmosphere even before kick-off and victory will taste even sweeter after the pain of last season's loss at the same stage, when City were almost in the final only to concede two stoppage-time goals and eventually go out.  The Champions League has inflicted various levels of anguish on City despite their domestic dominance but if they perform anything like this in Istanbul it is hard to see an efficient but unspectacular Inter side having enough to trouble them.  Real should never be written off with their history of success but there was an end-of-an-era feel about the manner of this defeat.  The side who put Liverpool and Chelsea out of the Champions League with the minimum of fuss looked its age here as City ran the holders ragged.  Luka Modric was taken off and replaced by Antonio Rudiger just after the hour, the 37-year-old's future at the Bernabeu uncertain, while even Karim Benzema, 35, was unable to pose his usual threat.  Real will refuse to stand still and the way they were outclassed here may only speed up the rate of change, with England's teenage sensation Jude Bellingham looking set to arrive to supplement the next generation midfielders alongside Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni.  Whether the great Carlo Ancelotti remains in charge will also be a point of debate with change often in the air if Real go a season without winning either La Liga or the Champions League.  Whatever the outcome, the Italian manager keeps his place in history as the only coach to win this tournament four times.

{"title": "Chelsea Champions League exit: Where do 'disjointed, broken' Blues go from here?", "content": "2003 If Todd Boehly thought visiting Chelsea's dressing room to deliver some home truths would inspire a Champions League miracle against Real Madrid he was, as he has been so often since arriving at Stamford Bridge, very much mistaken.  Co-owner Boehly decided it was time for the personal touch after  Saturday's home loss to Brighton,  although reportedly telling Chelsea's players their season had been \"embarrassing\" was not quite the morale-booster he maybe hoped for.  It also does not help that one of the main causes of Chelsea's current plight is the scattergun strategy and madcap transfer spree from their owners that has taken them to 11th in the Premier League and now out of the Champions League at the hands of the ruthless holders, who are always happy to apply brutal reality to any romantic notions.  And so it proved as Real Madrid saw out some spirited Chelsea efforts, struck twice through Rodrygo in the second half, and will now meet either Bayern Munich or Manchester City in the semi-final.  Boehly, through it all, stared out blankly from his executive box, Chelsea's season a complete washout and his hopes for a bounce from the return of Frank Lampard as interim manager have been more of a flatline as Real made it four defeats from four since the former midfielder took over from sacked Graham Potter.  This was certainly Chelsea's best performance under Lampard but was totally undermined by one of the great follies - and there have been a few - of Boehly and co-controlling owner Behdad Eghbali.  How can you spend £600m but fail to sign a player who would deliver the most precious quality of all? Goals.  Chelsea were always going to struggle to unsettle a Real team that regards panic as an alien concept, but any slim hopes they had were sabotaged by the number of presentable chances that came and went in what was actually a decent display.  Lampard's team boasts no recognised striker so when chances fell to defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante and left-back Marc Cucurella they were missed, with the inevitable consequences. Real are one of the most adept in the world at punishing teams for missed opportunities. They showed it against Manchester City in last season's Champions League semi-final and again here.  Chelsea are in the bottom half of the Premier League, out of the Champions League and will not be in it next season while Lampard is now effectively marking time and filling the manager's office until a new occupant can be found.  It is hard to see how Lampard can lift the mood either inside or outside the club. Getting the right manager has just been made more difficult by not having Champions League to offer. There will also be a huge churn of players after the lavish, unrewarding outlay this season.  It has been a dismal season and now Chelsea's owners, who have simply not had a handle on this at all, must use the time wisely to form a clear structure and find the manager they want after sacking Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter this season.  We must assume Boehly and co. have learned the harsh lessons of this season, very expensive ones. They have taken plenty of big decisions but they now need to actually start getting some right.  Chelsea need to identify and appoint the new manager and then lose the haphazard transfer policy that has seen players signed for exorbitant fees, often seemingly on the basis that other Premier League clubs were interested in them.  There is no doubting the ambition of Chelsea's owners - how could you after that expenditure? - but all it has brought is a disjointed, broken team with no obvious identity getting exactly what it has deserved from this season - nothing.  There has been no pattern or consistency as huge numbers of players flooded into west London and vast quantities of cash went out.   Lampard's team selection was conservative, no doubt wary of the fact Real are so expert at picking teams off, which meant big names such as Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Mykhailo Mudryk were on the bench.  Heavy responsibility also now lies with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, who felt Potter's time had to end and who have been leading the search for a new manager.  In previous years, under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, Chelsea cracked the code on how to not only survive but thrive amid much managerial churn and transfer dealings.   Not this time.  The first season under Abramovich's successors has been nothing short of chaos and abject mediocrity, a club so used to fighting for the big prizes reduced to running down the clock to the end of term with little other than respectability to aim for - and not much of that after this dismal campaign suffered another setback at the hands of Real.

{"title": "Champions League: Uefa must change revenue distribution, says Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish", "content": "European football's governing body Uefa must change how it hands out Champions League money, says Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish. Parish says Uefa's coefficient ranking system has helped Europe's elite clubs become \"entitled with winning\".  He feels that has also contributed to a \"two-speed Premier League\". \"There's a top half and a bottom half, and that disparity will get bigger and bigger unless we put some rules in to try to control it,\" Parish added. The Palace chairman was speaking at the launch of the Union of European Clubs (UEC) in Brussels on Monday. The UEC's general secretary, Dennis Gudasic, says that of the 22bn euros (£19.5bn) in revenue earned by Uefa from club competitions over the past 25 years, 34% of it has been distributed to a group of just 12 clubs. Currently 30% of Champions League revenue handed out to the 32 clubs in the group stage is determined by their coefficient ranking, which based on how that club has performed in Europe over the past decade. Clubs who have played in Europe regularly over that period get more of that 30% than those who have not. While Parish accepts the value of the Premier League's television broadcast deals means the distortion caused by European earnings is less stark in England than in other leagues, he believes Europe's top clubs have an unfair financial advantage. \"We've got six, now probably seven, teams [in England] where the amount of capital they have is either unlimited or is enormous compared to us, and qualifying for European football is almost impossible,\" he said. \"It still doesn't feel like a meritocracy entirely. And with the coefficient, it feels more and more that there's a two-speed Premier League. \"You're up against the situation where people have become so entitled with winning that they don't accept any system which challenges the status quo or threatens it, and I think that's what we have really got to look at across Europe.\" The UEC is an organisation which seeks to give a voice to more than 1,000 professional clubs in Europe. Representatives from 103 clubs were present for the UEC launch in person or online, with Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton and Watford the other English clubs represented. The UEC believes there are around 1,400 professional clubs in Europe who do not have a voice and should be represented on Uefa decision-making boards in the same way that member clubs of the European Club Association (ECA) are. The UEC says only 130 clubs have voting rights within the ECA. Parish also said Uefa's position as a regulator and commercial operator \"seems a massive conflict of interest\". \"I do believe there needs to be bigger separation of 'church and state', if you like,\" he said. \"The people organising the tournaments and the people regulating them, and taxing those tournaments for the greater good, should be two different people.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65380806"},

A report found Uefa bore  \"primary responsibility\"  for what almost led to a \"mass fatality catastrophe\" in Paris. Fans were penned in and sprayed with tear gas outside the Stade de France as kick-off was delayed by 36 minutes. Uefa and French authorities initially blamed ticketless fans for the events. On Friday, Uefa announced a number of new measures to improve safeguards for fans attending finals, saying they had held \"extensive and positive dialogue\" with fan groups, primarily through Football Supporters Europe (Fare). The changes are also based on recommendations from the independent report which was commissioned three days after the match - the showpiece of European club football which Liverpool lost 1-0 - took place in the French capital. Uefa's new measures to improve fan safety at finals include: Uefa general secretary Theodore Theodoridis said: \"We are fully committed to ensuring that every football fan can enjoy their team's appearance in a Uefa final in a safe, secure, and welcoming environment. \"By implementing the best practices outlined in our action plan and further engaging with fan groups, we are committed to ensuring that everyone can enjoy our events in a safe, inclusive and enjoyable atmosphere. \"We value their co-operation and will continue to work together to ensure that every supporter is heard, included and respected.\" Earlier this year, European football's governing body announced it would  refund fans  who had tickets for the final, covering all of the Liverpool ticket allocation - just over 19,000 fans - as well as other supporters \"most affected\" regardless of which team they supported.

Milan could face Inter Milan in the last four, with their city rivals going into Wednesday's second leg with Benfica holding a 2-0 lead. Serie A champions-elect Napoli dominated early on - but Milan won a penalty with one of their first attacks, although Olivier Giroud's spot-kick was saved by Alex Meret. The veteran Frenchman got the opening goal, though, to make it 2-0 on aggregate when he tapped in following a sensational 70-yard run by Rafael Leao to set him up. Napoli were then gifted a way back into the game when Fikayo Tomori handled in the box, but visiting keeper Mike Maignan saved Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's penalty. They did eventually score, through a Victor Osimhen header with seconds remaining in the match - and there was not enough time to create another chance. Napoli, who are 22 points clear of Milan in the league table, have lost form at a critical time and failed to take a host of opportunities, with 39 efforts across both legs. Milan, soon to be deposed by Napoli as Serie A champions, were seconds away from keeping a remarkable six consecutive Champions League clean sheets. But they will not worry too much about that as they celebrate their best European season for 16 years. Stefano Pioli's side have clearly focused on this competition, having rested all 10 outfield players in last weekend's Serie A draw with Bologna. The Rossoneri seem to have the number of Napoli too, with two wins and this draw against the same team in April. They won 4-0 on their league trip to Estadio Diego Armando Maradona earlier this month and beat them 1-0 in last week's first leg in Milan. They rode their luck somewhat in the early stages, although captain Davide Calabria did brilliantly to control Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia. They were awarded the penalty when Mario Rui caught Leao, but Giroud was denied by Meret in Milan's first shot of the game. But the 36-year-old made no mistake after Leao's brilliant run that had vibes of George Weah's solo goal in 1996 for Milan against Verona. They held off Napoli's attempted comeback with determined defending and, unless Benfica turn things round on Wednesday, will face Inter in a Champions League semi-final derby. Luciano Spalletti's Napoli are close to a first Serie A title since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona, and surely cannot let a 14-point lead over second-placed Lazio slip with eight games left.  This was their first European Cup quarter-final and expectations were high. But the top scorers in this season's Serie A and Champions League are not finishing the campaign as they would have hoped.  They had only lost three games in all competitions before April. Had the returning Osimhen not headed in late on for a second-leg draw, they would have lost as many against Milan in this month alone. And they also had Rui and Matteo Politano taken off with first-half injuries. Kvaratskhelia, despite being handled well by Calabria, was their most lively player, but missed several efforts including the penalty as the Georgian sensation's first Champions League season ended in disappointment. Now their attention will turn back to domestic competition and making sure they get the four wins they need to clinch the crown.

{"title": "Erling Haaland: Manchester City striker chasing Dixie Dean record after 50th goal of season", "content": "Another day, another goal for Erling Haaland - with even his manager surprised at the latest incredible statistic from the Manchester City striker's record-breaking season. Haaland converted a third-minute penalty in  City's 2-1 win over Fulham,  a result that took Pep Guardiola's side back to the top of the Premier League and a step closer to their fifth title in six seasons. It was the 22-year-old's 50th goal of the campaign in all competitions, following his £51.2m move from Borussia Dortmund in June. The spot-kick took the Norwegian forward past Clive Allen's mark of 49 goals for Tottenham back in 1986-87. Haaland has now scored the most goals by a top-flight player for 92 years - since Tom 'Pongo' Waring reached 50 for Aston Villa in 1930-31, when Ramsay MacDonald was the UK prime minister.  Waring's tally came in a season when Arsenal were champions, ahead of Villa, Sheffield Wednesday and Portsmouth, with Manchester United bottom and relegated from the old First Division, along with Leeds. \"Before Winston Churchill was prime minister? Wow. Sounds a long time ago,\" was Guardiola's reaction to hearing the latest Haaland-related statistic. \"Congratulations to Erling. The best goals to help us achieve what we want is still [to come] there. \"I was really impressed that he took the penalty with the strong mentality he has.\" Haaland has only needed 44 games to bring up his half-century - with 34 Premier League goals, 12 in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and one in the Carabao Cup. As well as pushing to win another league title, City are in the Champions League semi-finals and play Manchester United in the FA Cup final as they look to win the Treble. \"I say this in a polite way - Erling Haaland is a freak,\" said Premier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"If you were building a centre-forward from scratch then he would almost be it. \"He's very good in the air, quick, has a fantastic touch, he can bring people into the game and more importantly he scores a ton of goals. Everything about him is top quality. \"That's why Manchester City fought so hard to get him. He's phenomenal to watch.\" Haaland's next Premier League goal will break a record he currently shares with Shearer and Andrew Cole. Both Cole (for Newcastle in 1993-94) and Shearer (Blackburn, 1994-95) also netted 34 Premier League goals in one campaign - back when it was a 42-game season, rather than the 38 matches teams play now. Haaland still has a potential 10 matches to play this season - six in the Premier League, one in the FA Cup and a maximum of three in the Champions League if City reach the final. The all-time single-season English goalscoring record is the 63 goals Everton's Dixie Dean managed in 1927-28. Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards, speaking in February, said: \"Haaland is incredible. You feel as though he will break all records although surely Dean's 63 goals is impossible even for him.\" The way Haaland is playing, with 18 goals in his past 12 games, anything seems possible now.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65443667"},

Karim Benzema then scored an extra-time winner from the penalty spot to seal a stunning 6-5 aggregate triumph - and Carlo Ancelotti's side went on to beat Liverpool in the final. But is there is a real feeling things could be different this year after  City's 4-1 aggregate win over Bayern Munich  to reach a third semi-final in a row - especially with 48-goal striker Erling Haaland in their ranks. \"I had a feeling we would see them,\" said City boss Pep Guardiola, who once managed Real's arch-rivals Barcelona. \"All clubs know if you want to win the Champions League you need to beat Real Madrid.\" Real have won 14 European Cups, twice as many as anybody else - including five of the past nine. \"Hopefully yes!\" said City midfielder Bernardo Silva when asked about the chance of exacting revenge against the holders on 9 and 17 May, with the second leg at home. \"We will go for it definitely. We always go for it, but we feel the team is very, very confident at the minute. I think we are going through.\" Former City defender Nedum Onuoha was covering the game for BBC Radio 5 Live and thinks revenge will fuel their motivation. \"From a fan perspective they're definitely thinking about that,\" he added. \"I think they know that going into that 90th minute last year they were going to the final again. \"If you are the team that beats Real Madrid in this competition you have to believe you can win it all.\" Joleon Lescott, also a former City defender, said on BT Sport: \"Real Madrid are something special. Last year they weren't great and in a 12-minute spell they took the tie away.  \"I think Real Madrid have a belief in this competition they will produce. If they get seven chances, they will get five goals. \"But this is a different City. We haven't seen a Manchester City able to rely on the defensive side of the game as this one does.\" The winners of the last-four tie will face either AC Milan or Inter in the final, to be held in Istanbul on 10 June. Former Bayern and City midfielder Owen Hargreaves added on BT Sport: \"Credit Manchester City and Pep Guardiola, they are in a great place right now, definitely favourites to win the Champions League.\" Ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand said City \"have got to win\" and added: \"The conversations in both of those changing rooms will be, if we win this lads, we will have no better opportunity to win the Champions League. If you win this, you win it, no disrespect to the other teams.\" Former Liverpool player Stephen Warnock said: \"City are going to take some stopping. Real Madrid have the quality to stop them. \"Arsenal are looking over their shoulders [in the Premier League] and I still think that City will do it. I think they'll win the league and the Champions League. I think they're that good.\" City, second in the Premier League table and in the FA Cup semi-finals on the back of an unbeaten 15-match run, are chasing a trophy Treble. And Silva said: \"We struggled until February because we couldn't get in that usual run we had before of winning 10-15 games in a row, but now we are very consistent, we feel we have a chance in every competition and we are going for them. \"We are at that point of the season where, if you drop your performance in one game you are out of a competition. It is going to be tough but we are going to work very hard to bring some titles home.\" Norwegian striker Haaland - who also sent a first-half penalty over the bar - netted his 48th goal of the season against Bayern to give them the lead on the night, before Joshua Kimmich's penalty made it 1-1 and 4-1 to City on aggregate. \"Erling is a special player, a different player to what we had in the past,\" added Portugal midfielder Silva. \"He doesn't need many touches. He is like a shadow for 85 minutes and touches the ball once and it is a goal. When we have that special player in attack it makes us feel more comfortable at the back.\" Warnock said: \"Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano was petrified tonight. There were times when he was 10 yards deeper than Matthijs de Ligt because he was so fearful of Haaland's pace. \"You do get that fear when you are playing against a machine like Haaland. But when they play Real Madrid, Antonio Rudiger will go toe-to-toe with him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65331833"},
{"title": "Inter Milan 3-3 Benfica (Agg: 5-3): Inter book Champions League semi with arch-rivals AC Milan", "content": "149 Inter Milan secured a historic Champions League semi-final with arch-rivals AC Milan despite being held by Benfica at an ecstatic San Siro. Leading 2-0 from the first leg in Lisbon, Inter increased their aggregate lead following Nicolo Barella's sumptuous finish before a bullet header by Fredrik Aursnes gave Benfica hope. Argentina World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez and substitute Joaquin Correa made it 5-1 on aggregate before Benfica scored two late goals through Antonio Silva and Petar Musa. Inter have lost four of their past five games in Serie A to drop out of the Champions League places, but Simone Inzaghi's side can now look forward to two mouth-watering matches against Milan - who  knocked out Napoli  on Tuesday - for a place in the final. \"It will be a special derby,\" said Martinez. \"We all know what this game means, to play a Milan derby in the Champions League semi-finals. \"Happiness is the word, I'm so proud to represent this crest and this great club which is back to where it belongs.\" Inzaghi, the first Italian coach to lead Inter to the semi-finals of the European Cup since Eugenio Bersellini in 1980-81, said his team have nothing to fear against Milan. \"We deserve this semi-final. It was a dream but now we're here and we'll play it big,\" he added. Inter looked to be cruising when Italy midfielder Barella made it 3-0 on aggregate after creating space for himself inside the box before producing a wonderful curling finish. But Benfica were not done and Norway midfielder Aursnes kept the tie alive with a powerful header. The damage from the first leg was too much, however, as Martinez prodded home Federico Dimarco's cross before Correa netted two minutes after coming on. To their credit, Benfica kept going and Silva made it 3-2 on the night before substitute Musa equalised deep into stoppage time. However, it was not enough to stop Inter from booking their place in the semi-finals for the first time since 2010 - when they won the competition under Jose Mourinho. There were jubilant scenes at the end as home fans celebrated reaching the last four and a meeting with a team they know extremely well. Inter and city rivals Milan have already met three times this season, with Inter emerging triumphant in one Serie A game and the Italian Super Cup, while Milan won in the league. Now the rivals, who have been crowned champions of Europe 10 times between them, are gearing up for another two meetings to decide who goes through to the final in Istanbul on 10 June. They promise to be two magical and intense occasions at the iconic San Siro, which was a cauldron of noise on Wednesday for Benfica's visit. Despite the Portuguese club's late comeback on the night, the damage was done in the first leg last week. Both Milan clubs will hope next month's games pass without incident after their last meeting on the Champions League stage, 18 years ago, was abandoned because of crowd trouble. With Inter trailing 3-0 on aggregate, fans threw flares, one of which hit Milan's Brazilian keeper Dida on the shoulder. Play resumed for 30 seconds after a 20-minute delay before being abandoned, with Carlo Ancelotti's AC Milan going through to the semi-finals. \"No Inter or AC Milan fan wanted this clash, because the pressure is going to be unbelievable. \"They've been great in cup competitions, especially Inter who have beaten Milan in the Super Cup this season. When the Champions League lights shine then it's a completely different matter for both of them. \"I think both are under a lot of pressure. This is going to go down in history regardless.\" Formation    3-5-2 Formation    4-2-3-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65317328"},
{"title": "Chelsea 0-2 Real Madrid (Agg: 0-4): Blues exit Champions League as Real finish job", "content": "1396 Chelsea's hopes of salvaging success from a season of abject mediocrity were ended ruthlessly by Real Madrid as the holders advanced into the Champions League semi-final at Stamford Bridge.  The Blues were always battling against the odds to overturn a 2-0 deficit from the first leg in the Bernabeu and their cause was not helped by a familiar failing as a battling performance was undermined by missing a succession of clear chances.  N'Golo Kante missed a glorious first-half opening while Marc Cucurella was blocked by former Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois when he looked certain to reduce Real's advantage.  The Spanish champions had moments of their own and there are few sides more adept at making opponents pay for wasted opportunities and so it proved. A lightning counter attack led by Vinicius Junior ended with Rodrygo putting the tie to bed with a close-range finish just before the hour The Brazilian forward then walked in the second after brilliant, unselfish work by Federico Valverde with 10 minutes left.  Carlo Ancelotti's quest for an historic fifth win as a coach in this tournament will continue with a semi-final against either Bayern Munich or Manchester City while Chelsea's interim manager Frank Lampard, who now has four defeats from four games, must somehow lift the grim mood of despair around the club.  In among the many mistakes made by Chelsea's new ownership group led by Todd Boehly, one of the most obvious is shelling out £600m in a madcap transfer spree but failing to acquire someone who deals in the most precious commodity of all, namely goals.  Chelsea gave a very decent performance here, certainly the best of Frank Lampard's short reign, but a painful lack of end product meant there was almost an air of inevitability they would eventually be punished by the street wisdom and quality in Carlo Ancelotti's side.  Kante had Chelsea's best opportunities while Cucurella and substitute Mykhailo Mudryk also failed to cash in on good positions, although the latter's chance came with only minutes left and the tie over.  Chelsea are currently languishing in 11th place in the Premier League. They will not be in the Champions League next season, a big pull for potential purchases, while Boehly and the Clearlake group must find a manager to mend the fractures in the club after the sackings of Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter this season.  It will have to be ambition and reputation that lures that man because all the elite names who may come into contention will invariably wish to ply their trade in the Champions League.  Lampard will need to show some serious powers of motivation to inspire an upbeat end to the season at a club that has lost its way.  Real Madrid's reign as the kings of Europe continues into another Champions League semi-final and they will pose a massive threat to whoever they meet - most likely Manchester City as they hold a 3-0 advantage from the first leg against Bayern Munich.  They not only have the competition's most successful manager in four-time winner Ancelotti but possess a team of such vast experience that knows exactly how to get the job done. Chelsea followed Liverpool in being put away in the Champions League with the minimum of fuss.  Real are always able to find a hero from somewhere when it matters and here it was Rodrygo with two simple finishes, although man of the match was the outstanding Uruguayan Valverde.  This is a club that always believes it is their destiny to win the Champions League and they will be getting the old familiar feeling as they move into the last four once again.

{"title": "Champions League semi-finals: What to look for in Real Madrid v Manchester City & AC Milan v Inter Milan", "content": "The Champions League semi-finals start this week, with Manchester City facing European royalty Real Madrid and Inter Milan taking on AC Milan in a derby. City are trying to bounce back  from the heartbreak of last season's meeting at the same stage. They were seconds away from back-to-back finals, but Madrid scored twice in the final minute before netting an extra-time winner. But City have Erling Haaland now. The other game pits Inter against Milan, with both legs at their shared San Siro ground. That has happened twice before in the Champions League, with Milan beating Inter in the 2003 semis and 2005 quarters. So what else should we be looking out for? Manchester City have arguably been the most consistent team in Europe over the past decade not to win the Champions League. City are closing in on a fifth Premier League title in six years and a seventh since 2011-12. They have reached the semi-finals for the past three years - including losing the 2021 final to Chelsea - having got to the last eight for the three years before that. But City have yet to win the European crown. By contrast, since 2011-12 Chelsea and Liverpool have won as many Champions Leagues as Premier League titles - two and one respectively. Pep Guardiola's side have hit their stride at the perfect time too, with 20 games unbeaten taking them close to a first Treble by an English team since 1999. Guardiola will hope it goes better than Liverpool's quadruple effort last year, which saw them lose the Champions League final and miss out on the Premier League title. Haaland's 51 goals in 46 games have helped too, with Dixie Dean's 63 goals for Everton in 1927-28 - the all-time single-season English goalscoring record - still very much within his grasp. Football journalist Guillem Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"His arrival has had a tsunami effect on the rest of the team.  \"He is a strength when they get the ball long, he will score in the big games. He is a man for the big moments and that does affect the way Manchester City play.\" Julien Laurens said: \"They have found solidity. This team has a bit more and is a bit special compared to last year. \"It feels like it is City's year, they are going for the Treble. It just feels like there is something happening.\" Something seems to happen to Real Madrid in Europe - they just come alive. They have won five of the past nine Champions Leagues - despite only winning the Spanish league three times during that period. In two of those triumphant campaigns they only finished third in La Liga. That means you cannot read too much into their miserable domestic campaign, where they sit third again, 14 points off leaders Barcelona. And they have so much experience against English teams.  This will be their sixth knockout round in a row against Premier League sides, facing Liverpool, Chelsea and City this season and last.  They have succeeded in the previous five - beating Jurgen Klopp's side in last year's final.  Most people expected Victor Osimhen to be the striker to decide the quarter-final between Napoli and Milan, but the moment of the tie belonged to Rafael Leao. The 23-year-old Milan striker picked the ball up just outside his own box and ran nearly the whole length of the pitch before setting up Olivier Giroud for the goal that made it 2-1 on aggregate in the second leg. He had also been one of their liveliest players in the first leg too. Not to mention the two goals he scored against the now champions in their 4-0 Serie A win earlier in April. Portugal international Leao has really caught the eye in recent weeks and, despite a relatively modest goal haul of 13 this season, he has also created 10 goals. \"There are not many players like him in world football,\" said Laurens. Leao's contract runs out at the end of next season - with Chelsea among his reported suitors. Italian football journalist James Horncastle said: \"I think the hierarchy at AC Milan think that you can still have a competitive team when players are on half that [salary budget]. \"But they recognise that Leao is an exceptional talent and Leao has said he wants to stay. This is a deal they've got to get done.\" Balague added: \"If he goes to Chelsea or Manchester United, what happens to him? I see a player that can thrive with the ball. He seems unstoppable and in a tighter game with higher tempo I don't know if he'll be as impressive.\"  Leao is also a rapper, who goes by the name Way 45, and is set to release a second album this year. One of his songs has over a million views on YouTube. \"Zlatan Ibrahimovic laughed at it. He laughed at it and told me to focus on football instead,\" Leao told  Rolling Stone UK  in a recent interview. Ibrahimovic, meanwhile, is set to end his career without a single Champions League medal. The 41-year-old, who is expected to leave Milan this summer, is not registered in their Champions League squad as he was injured at the time they featured. Lukaku's return to Inter Milan has been a letdown for all concerned. The Belgian striker won Serie A with the club in 2020-21 and was named the Serie A player of the year, before moving to Chelsea, where he had a disappointing season. But his loan spell to Inter last summer has not rekindled his form.  He has only netted 10 goals this term, compared to 64 goals in his other two years in Italy. What a time this would be to start a scoring spree - although the BBC Euro Leagues team are not convinced that will happen. Laurens said: \"Over the two legs against Benfica, he was very important and scored a late penalty. But he was not a starter. So Lukaku might have to watch it from the bench first and then see if he can have an impact from the bench.  \"I'm not too optimistic.\" Balague said: \"He's aware he's not the most important at the moment. Right now, he doesn't have the confidence to do so. Where his confidence has been dented, he himself has to rebuild that, possibly at Chelsea next.\" Inter's top scorers this season are Lautaro Martinez and Edin Dzeko on 23 and 13 goals respectively. Horncastle added: \"Lukaku didn't fit in at Chelsea and it's the same system at Inter. He's had injuries and a World Cup in the middle and the management of him hasn't helped as they have flipped between him and Dzeko.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65392625"},

{"title": "Bayern Munich 1-1 Manchester City (agg 1-4): Haaland books Champions League semi spot", "content": "1328 Manchester City set up a Champions League semi-final clash with holders Real Madrid as Erling Haaland's goal ended Bayern Munich's hopes of a comeback. Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel felt his side needed a miracle to go through after losing the first leg 3-0 - and they squandered plenty of opportunities to get back into the game. Haaland made them pay as he lashed home a shot into the top corner to cap off a swift counter-attack, 15 seconds after Ederson had saved Kingsley Coman's shot at the other end. That was the Norwegian's 48th goal for City this season. He could have reached that figure earlier in the game but blazed over a penalty after a Dayot Upamecano handball. Just like in the first leg last week, Upamecano - who was also beaten easily for the 57th-minute goal - had a nightmare.  The French centre-back was shown a red card early in the game for a professional foul on Haaland, but it was overturned because the City striker was offside. Joshua Kimmich scored an 83rd-minute penalty for Bayern after a harsh handball decision against Manuel Akanji, but the German champions were never going to find three more goals in the last seven minutes. Boss Tuchel was also sent to the stands for two yellow cards in what was a very fractious and fiery encounter at times. There was no doubt City deserved to progress over the two legs and their Treble dream remains alive, with the Premier League and FA Cup other trophy targets this season. Kimmich's spot-kick, though, ended their 10-game winning run in all competitions. City are now unbeaten in 15 games since they lost at Tottenham on 5 February and were minutes away from an 11th win in a row. Win their final 13 matches and they will be the first English team to win the Treble since Manchester United in 1999. That picture will become clearer over the next week as they face Sheffield United in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday and then leaders Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday. When City get going like this late in the season, though, it can be hard to stop them. This tie was all but won last week at Etihad Stadium - and Pep Guardiola finally seems to have learned from past accusations of overthinking tactics and formations in big European games - most famously in the 2021 final defeat by Tuchel's Chelsea. City have found the perfect formula and named the same XI in a third consecutive Champions League game for the first time. Keeper Ederson was there when needed and the outcome at the Allianz Arena could have been very different had he not denied Coman after 56 minutes. Instead of 3-1 on aggregate it was 4-0. John Stones immediately pumped a long ball to Haaland, who headed it down for Kevin de Bruyne. The Belgian fed Haaland to smash in goal number 48 of an incredible season. Everton icon Dixie Dean's English record of 63 goals is still in his sights. City also kept their heads and comfortably saw the game out after Kimmich scored when Akanji was penalised by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for handling substitute Sadio Mane's cross. This is now their third Champions League semi-final in a row as they bid to finally win Europe's biggest club competition. In their way, though, are European royalty in the shape of Real,  who beat them 6-5 on aggregate  after a second-leg comeback for the ages at the same last-four stage last season.  Bayern's decision to dismiss last season's Bundesliga-winning boss Julian Nagelsmann and replace him with Tuchel, who was sacked by Chelsea earlier this season, raised some eyebrows. Two wins in six games, including Champions League and German Cup exits, have left many wondering if it was the right call. It is the worst start for a Bayern boss since Soren Lerby in 1991. Even before Tuchel's arrival, the club lacked the aura of previous years. Instead of Robert Lewandowski, their main man up front is ex-Stoke striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. Manuel Neuer, one of the world's top keepers of this generation, is out with a broken leg - and Mane, their big summer signing, has not impressed since joining from Liverpool. The forward was back in the squad for this one after allegedly punching Leroy Sane following Bayern's first-leg defeat. Upamecano was shaky at the back, having a red card rescinded, picking up a yellow for handball on the penalty and then culpable as Haaland claimed the crucial first goal. Former City winger Sane wasted several first-half chances, including an early one that he slipped wide with just Ederson to beat. Full-back Joao Cancelo, on loan from their English opponents, was also booked for a foul on his close friend and old house-mate Bernardo Silva. Tuchel - who saw red late on for his furious touchline reactions to refereeing decisions - can now fully concentrate on the Bundesliga, with Bayern two points above his old club Borussia Dortmund with six games to go. Fail to win that - Bayern have won the past 10 league titles - and Tuchel's position could be under threat.

{"title": "Naples: A city on the brink as Napoli close in on first title in 33 years", "content": "Naples is a city on the brink. You can see it, hear it, feel it. It's in the eyes and the smiles, the playful chatter and swaggering strides. Neapolitans can taste it, they're living every moment of it.  Napoli are 16 points clear in Serie A and cantering towards a first title since 1990. Flags hailing what will be the club's third championship hang from balconies, banners with \"100% campione\" ripple in the breeze. Even the usually superstitious Neapolitans can't help but acknowledge this is their year. Clinch the Scudetto too early and some fear the city won't cope with a party 33 years in the making. Win the Champions League too? Well, the \"skies will fall,\" beams Daniele 'Decibel' Bellini. \"It's magical.\" Provisions are in place for a party on 4 June - the final day of the season - but Napoli's wait for a first championship since Diego Maradona strolled these narrow streets could end in the next few weeks. Fifteen points from their final 10 games will make it certain, even if second-placed Lazio win all of theirs. In the Quartieri Spagnoli, throughout Naples' historic centre, up to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in Fuorigrotta and beyond, the streets are decked with blue and white festoons. Buildings and steps have been painted the same hues. Life-size cutouts of the current squad stand in one piazza, club shirts and player posters are pegged to washing lines in alleyways and youngsters queue for half a block to buy Napoli-coloured panino at  popular sandwich shop Con Mollica o Senza. Hotel rooms for the next couple of months have nearly all gone. Expats wanting to celebrate, football fans intrigued by Napoli's story and visitors unexpectedly caught up in this historic moment are descending on the city. Sporting success coincides with a tourist boom. \"Naples is experiencing a moment of self-recognition and rediscovery of its greatness,\" says author Angelo Forgione. When Maradona inspired Napoli to a first Scudetto in 1987, fans placed a banner outside the city's largest cemetery proclaiming: \"You don't know what you missed.\" Now, a generation too young to remember such glory are living it themselves. \"I was six months old in 1990 but I grew up watching VHS of Diego Maradona,\" says Vincenzo Credendino, from CalcioNapoli24 TV. \"Now this Scudetto is like reconnecting with that time.\" Tributes to Luciano Spalletti's players intertwine with endless Maradona artwork. He is everywhere in Naples' charmingly gritty and dizzyingly chaotic labyrinth of streets - bar windows, bumper stickers, on billboards and etched across crumbling walls in giant murals. At Bar Nilo, a strand of Maradona's hair rotates as part of a shrine to the Argentine. In an underground museum the belongings acquired by his maid's son when Maradona left the city are on display. \"Maradona is like God here,\" says 23-year-old fan Maria Roberta De Iesu. \"He gave people hope. Neapolitans see themselves in Maradona.\" When Maradona arrived for a world record fee from Barcelona in July 1984, the city was still on its knees from an earthquake that killed almost 2,500 people four years earlier. Feuds between the Camorra, the region's mafia, were as bitter as ever, unemployment was huge and the Bank of Naples was facing bankruptcy. \"Yet in a Naples on the bottom, Napoli, with the help of politics, managed to buy the strongest and most expensive footballer in the world and touch the sky,\" adds Forgione.  Then president Corrado Ferlaino had to lean on the city's mayor to help finance the deal, fans offered contributions to help get it over the line, anything to get Maradona. 'El Pibe de Oro' was everything to Naples, and Naples was everything to him. The city resonated with its Golden Boy not just because he inspired their club to two Serie A titles and a Uefa Cup but because they recognised him. He was anti-establishment, he echoed their principles and shouldered their concerns. \"Maradona was really good with his tongue, his mouth, his attitude,\" explains Credendino. \"He understood how to get the heart of the Neapolitan people, he touched the right chords.\" Maradona, despite his relationship with the Neapolitan mafia, brought \"justice to the people\" after struggles against the north that date back more than a century to the unification of Italy, says culture expert Francesco Carignani. \"He had many problems in his life but in Naples we only remember him for the joy,\" adds fan Paolo Cimmino. \"We connect him as a man to a conqueror - the south won versus the north.\" No club south of Rome has won Serie A since the Napoli of Maradona, Careca, Ciro Ferrara and a young Gianfranco Zola in 1990, and Neapolitans still endure hostile taunts from their northern rivals about crime, poverty, cholera outbreaks and calls for Mount Vesuvius to erupt over the city. People here \"are first of all Neapolitans and then Italian\", explains Bellini, Napoli's iconic stadium announcer. They have their own language, culture and history. Naples was once a thriving European capital, it remains a city of intriguing architecture, Caravaggio, pizza. Most of all, there is an intensity to life in Campania. \"Southern people in Italy, they live everything with love, with so much emotion, in different ways to the north,\" adds Cimmino.  Napoli had to fall before they could rise again. Financial decline, relegation and bankruptcy followed the glory years but the fans remained. More than 50,000 attended a game in Serie C in 2004-05. \"For our city soccer is so important,\" explains journalist Elena Lopresti. \"It is not only football, it is a social instrument, a tool to develop us as a society.\" Film producer Aurelio de Laurentiis seized an opportunity to purchase the club in 2004 and restore top-flight and European football to Napoli, the fourth-most well-supported club in Italy after Juventus, Milan and Inter, but one whose fanbase is concentrated in the region, rather than spread \"from the Alps to Sicily\" as Forgione says of the big three. \"De Laurentiis had a parachute,\" adds Credendino. \"It was the love of the people, always ready to go to the stadium, always ready to support the team.\" Naples, Forgione explains, is a rare European metropolis represented by a single club. \"Napoli's victory is the victory of identity, of those who live it completely,\" he adds. \"In Naples, football is everything,\" says Cimmino. \"It is joy, it is love, it is fun, it is sadness. It is a way to escape from the daily problems, a way to have fun with the people and party, and this period is happiness.\" The De Laurentiis era has been characterised by astute recruitment - Edinson Cavani, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Jorginho, Gonzalo Higuain - profitable sales, and falling short in the title race. It was only last summer, after another championship bid slipped away, that ultras promised to return boss Spalletti's stolen Fiat Panda on the condition he left the club. \"Now he deserves a Ferrari, not a Panda,\" laughs journalist Credendino.  Spalletti is not from Naples, but he shares that Neapolitan passion. After being sacked by Inter, he spent two years on his farm in Tuscany before taking on the Napoli job. Now he lives by the training ground working relentlessly to deliver the Scudetto. Maradona was the face of Napoli's previous triumph but this time unfamiliar heroes have emerged - cleverly acquired by sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli and fuelled by Spalletti's coaching. \"Giuntoli is the man of this miracle,\" says Credendino, despite some fans fretting when the club sold high-profile stars Kalidou Koulibaly, Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens last year. \"Giuntoli discovered Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, he discovered Victor Osimhen, Kim Min-jae,\" adds Cimmino. \"Spalletti makes this talent, makes this character. He can find the right keys to get the best of all the players. [Slovak midfielder Stanislav] Lobotka now looks like Iniesta, he looks like Xavi.\" On a sold-out match day against Milan, outside the stadium that bears Maradona's name - an amphitheatre worthy of the Greeks who founded Neapolis, the \"new city\" - kids sport the mask of top scorer Osimhen and Georgian flags fly for irrepressible winger Kvaratskhelia.  There are a sprinkling of Boca and Argentina jerseys too, and, if there is a likeness to Maradona in this team, it is 22-year-old Kvaratskhelia. Signed from Dinamo Batumi last summer, he's aptly been dubbed \"Kvaradona\", but Cimmino sees him like  Gianluigi Lentini at Torino  or Kaka during his Milan years. \"He is incredibly unpredictable in the field,\" adds Credendino. \"But if Maradona was a demigod, Kvaratskhelia is the Pope. He has a totally different attitude, a totally different personality.\" Kvaratskhelia plays with a rugged urgency, socks around his ankles, calves exposed. He cavorts, he conjures. But against Milan on Sunday, without 21-goal forward Osimhen - a man Spalletti calls a \"dragon with two heads\" - he could not stop a vacant and disjointed Napoli sliding to a jarring 4-0 defeat. Milan were supposed to graciously pass on the champions' baton. Instead they slapped down a reminder the upcoming Champions League quarter-final between the two - the first leg is on Wednesday - should not be taken for granted. Neapolitans' relationship with their club is complex. Rather than the result, the fallout was about wider issues. Scuffles broke out between different sets of ultras in Curva B over how to protest against De Laurentiis' ticket prices and rules over which flags or banners they can bring into the ground. \"De Laurentiis has a really complicated relationship with the city because the supporters don't like the power, and he represented the power,\" explains Carignani. \"But we have to say that this victory is great for him because he is a great businessman, he put passion in the city but also his entrepreneurship view in managing the team and that has made the difference.\" In the next few weeks, supporters and the board will both celebrate Napoli's first title in more than three decades. The fans have been asking the city's patron saint San Gennaro for this moment, they have called on the spirit of Maradona. Residents have been saving up in preparation for the mother of all celebrations.  \"We just feel this power, this emotion,\" says De Iesu. \"It will be a great party all around the city, all the squares will be full of people.\" \"Now we are enjoying it,\" adds Carignani. \"It was worth the wait.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65193538"},

A recent independent report found Uefa bore  \"primary responsibility\"  for what almost led to a \"mass fatality catastrophe\" in Paris last May. Fans were penned in and sprayed with tear gas outside the Stade de France as kick-off was delayed by 36 minutes. Law firm Leigh Day has issued Uefa with a group personal injury claim. The Liverpool-based firm issued the claim on behalf of 887 clients at the Liverpool District Registry of the High Court on Monday. Leigh Day is bringing the claim on the basis European football's governing body had failed to ensure a safe and secure environment for those attending and could owe a legal liability to those who suffered physical or psychological injuries In September, law firm Bingham's teamed up with global law company Pogust Goodhead in a  lawsuit for 1,450 clients , suing Uefa for breach of contract in ticket sales and negligence over a duty of care they had towards supporters, who were harmed physically and psychologically. Earlier this year, Uefa said it would  refund Liverpool fans  who had tickets for the final against Real Madrid. The governing body and French authorities initially blamed ticketless fans for the events outside the stadium, but the independent report - which Uefa commissioned after the 28 May showpiece - said there was \"no evidence\" to support the \"reprehensible\" claims. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin appeared to allude to his organisation's failings at the final at Wednesday's Uefa Congress in Lisbon. \"We must never forget the mistakes of the past and we must remain humble at all times,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, unlike goalkeepers, leaders can never keep a 'clean sheet'. No leader can boast an unblemished record, however much they invest and however passionate, professional or experienced they are. \"There are always a few stains, a few mistakes that tarnish our reputation, errors they would love to erase. \"I am no different and Uefa is no different.

{"title": "Manchester City v Bayern Munich: Sleepless nights for Thomas Tuchel before Champions League quarter-final", "content": "Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel admits he is having sleepless nights before his side's Champions League meeting with Manchester City. Tuchel returns to England for the first time since he was  sacked by Chelsea in September  when City host the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday (20:00 BST). In 10 previous meetings, Tuchel has only beaten a side managed by Pep Guardiola on three occasions. \"I will try to go to bed early. I hope I will be able to sleep,\" he said. \"The best preparation is sleep but sometimes it is hard to get that sleep when you're thinking about things. \"This morning I woke up really early and I just decided to go to the training ground because I couldn't get back to sleep. I just kept thinking about the match.\" Tuchel's last win over Guardiola came in 2021, when  Chelsea beat City in the Champions League final  for the first of three trophies the German won in his 20 months at Stamford Bridge. City went on to twice beat Chelsea in the Premier League before Tuchel's departure, while they have not faced Bayern since November 2014 when, under Manuel Pellegrini, they beat the Bundesliga side 3-2 to reach the last 16. Tuchel, who  replaced the sacked Julian Nagelsmann  at league leaders Bayern in March, says his side will need to be at the \"top of our game\" in order to beat City, who have won their past eight games in all competitions. \"I don't think I can learn much from other games I've played against Pep,\" he said. \"It's unique what Pep does. We'll try to find solutions but we'll need a complete performance to create problems for City.\" He added: \"It is a major task in front of us. I was just outside [at Etihad Stadium] and that is the current gold standard for us. \"We want to live up to that but the team is entitled to be confident after our results and performances in the Champions League so far and we have to try to continue like that. \"Maybe we play in a role of slight underdog, which is not a problem. We'll try to make the most of it. We need to be confident and on top of our game.\" Tuesday's match will see Bayern full-back Joao Cancelo return to Manchester for the first time since his January loan move from City. The 28-year-old Portugal defender fell out of favour at the club and moved to Germany for the remainder of the season, with Bayern having the option to sign him for 70m euros (£61.4m) in the summer. Tuchel said he is \"happy\" Cancelo is in his side but discussions have not taken place as to whether Bayern will make his move permanent. On Cancelo facing his parent club, Tuchel said: \"I hope he can manage his emotions and he is not over-motivated and over-excited. \"But I also hope he is not too shy. It is not enough to know it. A lot of people know smoking is bad for you but they still do it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65235363"},
{"title": "Man City v Bayern Munich: Loan players who haunted parent clubs - can Cancelo do similar?", "content": "Joao Cancelo has the chance to become the latest player to haunt his parent club when Bayern Munich face Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday at Etihad Stadium. The Portugal full-back  joined Bayern in a surprise loan move  in January after 154 games and two league titles for City. Unlike in the Premier League, Uefa competitions allow players to play against their permanent employers. BBC Sport looks at some previous times players have made their parent clubs pay. Until 2003 Premier League clubs could not sign players on loan from other teams in the division. That rule needed tweaking again because of Lomana LuaLua. Portsmouth signed the DR Congo winger on a three-month loan deal from Newcastle in February 2004 - the first season such moves were permitted. Four weeks later, on his first start for Portsmouth,  he netted an 89th-minute equaliser  against his parent club. \"I was a bit surprised I was allowed to play, it is not usual in these sort of deals,\"  said LuaLua  - who celebrated in front of the Magpies fans. Newcastle boss Bobby Robson, whose side ended up missing out on the Champions League that season by four points, admitted: \"He was the last player we wanted to score against us. One of our players has taken a point off us.\" LuaLua joined Pompey permanently at the end of the season - and the Premier League decided loan players could not face their parent clubs any more. David Nielsen joined Norwich from Division One (now Championship) rivals Wimbledon in a loan move in December 2001. In his second game for the Canaries,  he faced the Dons.  The striker opened the scoring with a diving header and then won a penalty which Iwan Roberts scored. Dons keeper Kelvin Davis was so angry with a player who was technically still his team-mate that he threw the ball at the Dane and was sent off. Norwich won 2-1, Nielsen joined them permanently after scoring five goals in five games and they beat the Dons to a play-off place. This one was so controversial  the authorities ended up getting involved. When Chelsea loaned Thibaut Courtois to Atletico Madrid for a third season in a row, they said if the sides met in the Champions League that the goalkeeper could only play if Atletico paid them a reported £2.5m fee per game. The sides were indeed drawn against each other in the 2013-14 semi-finals, but Atletico said they could not afford to pay the fee. They went to Uefa, who said such a deal that \"might function in such a way as to influence who a club fields in a match is null, void and unenforceable\" and Courtois could play without £5m being shelled over. The Belgian kept a clean sheet in a goalless first leg and made four saves at Stamford Bridge as his side progressed 3-1 on aggregate. He was one of the few players in this article to go on to have a career with his parent club, spending the next four seasons as Chelsea's number one before joining Real Madrid. It is probably fair to say Barcelona wish they had never bothered signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool in 2018 when they made him the third most expensive signing ever - for a fee of up to £142m. He underwhelmed in his three and a half seasons in the Barcelona team - and had a hand in one of the most embarrassing nights in their history. The Brazilian forward joined Bayern Munich on loan in 2019-20 - and scored twice and assisted one in their one-leg   8-2 Champions League quarter-final win  over Barca in Lisbon. Despite that, Bayern declined the chance to sign Coutinho for 120m euros and two years and just five Barcelona goals later he joined Aston Villa for 100m euros less. Fernando Morientes won the Champions League three times in six full seasons at Real Madrid - but also helped to knock them out. In 2003-04 he joined Monaco on a season-long loan and netted in both legs of their quarter-final thriller against Real - which they won on away goals after a 5-5 aggregate score. \"It was very difficult for me. In front of me were all my friends, my old team-mates, my big friends Raul, Figo, Zidane. You try to be professional in this moment,\"   he said years later. The Spanish striker ended up winning the Champions League Golden Boot that season with nine goals, as his temporary side lost the final to Porto.  Morientes was back at Real at the start of the next season, but England striker Michael Owen kept him on the bench and he joined Liverpool six months later. Parent clubs, former clubs, it doesn't matter - Kingsley Coman loves scoring against them in the Champions League. The France winger, whose sides have won a league title in each of his first 10 seasons as a professional footballer, joined Bayern Munich on loan from Juventus in 2015-16. He had netted just once for the Italian club in a year. And he made his parent club pay in the Champions League last 16, setting Thomas Muller up in injury time to send the game to extra time and then netting in the 110th minute as his loan side won 6-4 on aggregate. He went on to join Bayern permanently and in the 2020 Champions League final netted the only goal against his first club, Paris St-Germain. It is always good to send a young player out on loan to give them experience... except if it costs you the league title. Ajax probably did not think too much of it when they loaned young Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen to struggling RKC Waalwijk in January 2007. But on 8 April, with four games left of the season, he scored in Waalwijk's 2-2 draw with Ajax. Three weeks later Ajax lost the title on goal difference to PSV Eindhoven. Without that goal, Ajax would have won the title. To make matters worse Waalwijk were relegated anyway. Ajax and Vertonghen would have to wait another four years to win the title together.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65091090"},
{"title": "Champions League quarter-finals: Tuchel, Guardiola, Lampard, Kvaratskhelia, Benfica", "content": "The real business end of the Champions League starts this week with the final eight going head to head in the quarter-final first legs. With more teams left from Italy than any other country and Benfica also through to the latter stages, there is a different shape to recent years. Could we be in for a surprise winner and how might Chelsea and Manchester City, the Premier League's remaining representatives fare? BBC Sport looks at some of the key talking points. Guardiola goes back to face his old club for the first time since leaving Bayern Munich for Manchester City in 2016. He was expecting to face a Julian Nagelsmann team again (having beaten his Hoffenheim twice in 2018-19), but the German side recently sacked him and appointed Thomas Tuchel - a name Guardiola is even more familiar with. The managers have met 10 times before during a decade-long rivalry with Guardiola winning six and Tuchel three - those successes all coming in a six-week spell between 17 April and 29 May 2021. That run - which included Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final and Champions League final wins over City - led to a feeling that Tuchel had the edge on Guardiola. In that final Guardiola famously did not play a defensive midfielder in a tactical gamble that failed. But City beat Tuchel's Chelsea twice in the Premier League last season, and with four wins and a draw in Germany, including the 2016 DFB-Pokal final, Guardiola actually has the much better record. Guardiola has had a mixed time against his old clubs. He has faced Barcelona four times since leaving - twice with City and twice with Bayern. He won two of those, but the other matches were 3-0 and 4-0 defeats. In 2020-21, Chelsea started the season with Frank Lampard in charge and ended it with Tuchel leading them to Champions League glory. In 2022-23 Chelsea started the season with Tuchel in charge and will end it with Lampard hoping to lead them to Champions League glory. Lampard is the fourth man to manage Chelsea this season after the sacked Tuchel, the sacked Graham Potter and brief interim boss Bruno Saltor. He is hoping to keep up an unusual club tradition, winning a European trophy in the first season of his reign - although unlike the others this is his second spell in charge. Remarkably (even allowing for their love of chopping and changing bosses) Chelsea's last five European trophies have all come with managers who had taken over that season. Four of those five took during the season, three of them after Christmas. Potter may have hoped to join that club but he was sacked last week, with Bruno briefly having that opportunity too - he had initially been expected to be in charge until the end of the season. In 2022 it was Potter's predecessor Tuchel and the Champions League. The German had taken over in January. Italian Maurizio Sarri won the 2019 Europa League in his only season as Chelsea boss. Former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez led Chelsea to the 2013 Europa League, having been interim manager from November. The season before, Roberto di Matteo had been interim boss for less than three months when he took them to 2012 Champions League glory. And in February 1998 the late Gianluca Vialli was made Chelsea player-manager and guided them to a European Cup Winners' Cup victory that summer. Dave Sexton is the only Chelsea manager to win a European trophy more than a year into his reign, the 1971 Cup Winners' Cup. So can Lampard, who won the 2011-12 Champions League as a Chelsea player, add his name to that list? In their way in the quarter-finals are European royalty Real Madrid, although Chelsea have a good record against them - losing only once in seven meetings. That is the lowest percentage of losses against Real (14%) of any side to have played them at least five times in Europe. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia  is a remarkable throwback and something which seemed impossible in modern football. Nine months ago the average football fan would never have even heard his name, with all Kvaratskhelia's football being played in the Georgian and Russian leagues plus two Europa Conference League appearances. And now the Georgian winger is genuinely a superstar and one of the form players in one of the best teams in European football, Serie A's runaway leaders Napoli. In Serie A, Kvaratskhelia has 12 goals - only behind four players - and 10 assists - more than anybody else. Paris St-Germain duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani and Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka are the only other players to have double figures for both goals and assists in Europe's top five leagues. In the Champions League nobody has more than Kvaratskhelia's four assists. Kvaratskhelia and Napoli will be hopeful that story can continue with a relatively kind quarter-final draw - against AC Milan, who sit 22 points below them in the table. However  Milan did beat them 4-0 earlier this month. You would not know this was a Benfica team who sold over £200m worth of talent this season.  First it was star striker Darwin Nunez to Liverpool for a fee of between £64m and £85m - and then midfielder Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea for £107m. More than 30 other players have left the club this season. And yet under German journeyman manager Roger Schmidt, they look almost unbeatable. In 46 games in all competitions since appointing the former PSV boss in the summer they have only lost twice - however one of them was on Friday at home to Porto. They finished top of a Champions League group involving PSG and Juventus, picking up 13 points more than the Italians - and then blew away Club Bruges in the last 16, costing Scott Parker his job. They are seven points clear of Porto at the top of the Portuguese league as they close in on a first trophy since 2019. Only Italian teams stand between them and a first European Cup final since 1990, with the winner of their tie against Inter playing AC Milan or Napoli in the semi-finals.

{"title": "Champions League: How Italian clubs turned their European fortunes around", "content": "Twenty years ago an Italian presence in the latter stages of the Champions League was a regular occurrence.  But at the beginning of this season not even the most optimistic Serie A fan would have dreamed three Italian sides would reach the quarter-finals of Europe's premier club competition. However, as the last eight arrives there are three Italian representatives - last season's Scudetto winners AC Milan face  this year's runaway leaders Napoli,  while Inter take on Benfica. The last time Italy saw three clubs reach the quarters was in 2006. Three years earlier, three teams made the semis, while no Italian side has won the competition since Inter in 2010. So what sparked the Serie A renaissance? Italian sides used to be a part of the European elite. Unsurprisingly, their strength coincided with economic power, which saw star names attracted to Serie A. Things have changed dramatically in the past 15 years. The arrival of billionaire owners across the continent has changed the balance of power and the way clubs do business. Italian clubs' presidents tended to be businessmen who used their teams as a PR tool to pursue local interests - see TV tycoon and politician Silvio Berlusconi at AC Milan, or Callisto Tanzi and his Parmalat holding at Parma. The new owners of international football have stormed in with global resources, goals and methodologies. Italian football, rooted in its traditions and defects, failed to keep up. It had neither the ability nor the will to plan ahead, create a system and attract foreign investors. Potential buyers decided to take their businesses to other leagues in Europe with foreign capital only recently bolstering Italian clubs' coffers.  Things have finally started to change, and seven Serie A clubs - including Milan and Inter - now belong to foreign owners, five from the US, one from Canada and one from China. The general state of Italian football hasn't changed much in the past 10 years, but a lack of resources forced some clubs to act more soberly. Napoli are the perfect example. President Aurelio de Laurentiis bought the club in 2004 as it went bankrupt and the Partenopei have since experienced steady growth. On the pitch, Napoli have been Serie A runners-up three times and won three Coppa Italia titles, while playing European football for 13 years in a row. Off it, they kept their books tidy, growing step by step - before last summer's masterpiece. The club sold stalwarts such as Lorenzo Insigne and Kalidou Koulibaly, signed superb talents like  Khvicha Kvaratskhelia  and Kim Min-jae on cheap deals, and have seen Victor Osimhen become the most-wanted striker in Europe - all while reducing the total payroll by 30-35%. Under Luciano Spalletti  Napoli are the most surprising team of the year and the most exciting to watch, pairing quality and consistency both at home and abroad. The whole club grew through planning and the power of ideas - revenues from Gonzalo Higuain's transfer to Juventus and Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi's moves to Paris St-Germain were not used to buy over-expensive replacements.  Year after year, De Laurentiis and the technical staff kept building. AC Milan's story is similar to Napoli's, albeit shorter - today's Rossoneri are the result of a project built on the ruins Berlusconi and Chinese businessman Yonghong Li left behind.  The latter bought the club off Berlusconi in April 2017, only to hand it over 448 days later to American hedge fund Elliott after defaulting on a payment. Red Bird Capital took over from Elliott last summer and have continued the style and strategy put in place. It has been based on a few solid pillars: the identity given by Paolo Maldini's return; the recruitment of promising youngsters like Rafael Leao, Mike Maignan, Pierre Kalulu and Malick Thiaw; and the winning mentality instilled by experienced players such as Olivier Giroud and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Two seasons ago, the Rossoneri ended a seven-year drought by qualifying for the Champions League, and then won their first Italian league title in 11 years in 2022. Milan are attractive to sponsors and very active on the business side of things - they have stakes in fashion, music and show business. It is a shared project at all levels, based on an attack-minded manager in Stefano Pioli and the strict respect of Uefa's economical parameters. Lacking the money other clubs could spend, the Rossoneri based their resurrection on ideas and attractive football. Of the Serie A clubs still in the competition, Inter boast the most mature squad and the biggest wage bill, although their financial situation might force them to sell players in the summer.  Romelu Lukaku was off-loaded two years ago to Chelsea, just to come back on loan after a disappointing season in London, while Milan Skriniar has not extended his contract and will leave as a free agent to PSG in July.  Premier League clubs also seem keen on signing Andre Onana and Denzel Dumfries. Inter are less proactive compared to Napoli and Milan but have earned their place in the last eight - obstinate defence saw them past Porto in the last 16 after they deservedly survived a group which included Bayern Munich and Barcelona. \"[Inter] are a tactical team, waiting for opponents' mistakes to hurt them, while [Napoli and Milan] are strategic teams, willing to impose their style of play,\" former Milan boss Arrigo Sacchi said in Gazzetta dello Sport. \"The will to play football always pays off. Milan and Napoli have more chances to get to the end of the competition.\" Was  Roma's Conference League trophy  the first of many to come for Serie A clubs in Europe? What was the effect of a World Cup played in winter, with no Italian players involved? There is no easy answer. The Azzurri deservedly won Euro 2020, but have not played in a World Cup for the past decade. They also started their new European qualification campaign on the wrong foot, losing to England in Naples. Boss Roberto Mancini has called up Argentina-born Mateo Retegui in his search for a centre forward, and is ready to look abroad for more players with Italian heritage to boost the national side. Asked about the potential renaissance of Italian football, Mancini said: \"It hasn't happened, this is club football. Only six or seven Italian players are actually part of Napoli, Milan and Inter's starting XIs. \"Thirty-three players would have been fantastic; 50% of them good, 30% also OK. The thing is, some U19 games in Italy take place without a single Italian player on the pitch.\" It is a fact that Italian clubs have a problem with their academies. Where are all the present and future Pirlos, Tottis and Del Pieros? Overall, there are six Italian clubs in the quarter-finals of the three European competitions, a quarter of the total; Milan, Napoli and Inter are joined by Juventus and Roma in the Europa League and Fiorentina in the Conference League. One Italian club is guaranteed to play in the Champions League semi-finals, and it will be two if Inter can eliminate Portuguese opponents for a second round in succession. But is this a one-off or can Italian clubs repeat the feat next year? Realistically, the economic gap between Serie A clubs and European football's superpowers remains vast - and it will not be bridged any time soon. However, that financial chasm has forced some clubs to think out of their usual Italian box with Napoli, Milan and Inter's runs this season proof Serie A sides can succeed. But those successes do not extend to the whole of Italian football.  Not all that glitters is gold,  as Italy know all too well  after their struggles since winning the Euros at Wembley.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65201563"},
{"title": "Man City 3-0 Bayern Munich: Pep Guardiola's side deliver statement Champions League win", "content": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola claimed he was \"emotionally destroyed\" after seeing his side overwhelm Bayern Munich to place one foot in the Champions League semi-finals.  You can only imagine how their opponents felt.  City have delivered statement Champions League performances under Guardiola before only for it all to end in tears.  For all their domestic brilliance, Guardiola's outstanding work at Etihad Stadium will be judged - rightly or wrongly - through the prism of whether or not he wins Europe's elite club competition, a crown he claimed twice at Barcelona.  City have found a variety of ways to exit the Champions League when it looked to be their year, from  defeat in the final against Chelsea  in 2021 to when they were hit by football's version of a bolt of lightning  against Real Madrid in the semi-final 12 months ago,  conceding two goals in stoppage time when victory looked assured.  But this season feels different.  Bayern are dangerous, quality opponents, yet they were simply overpowered by City's force of will and all-round quality.  The visitors threatened of course - Guardiola said he felt like he had aged a decade come the final whistle - but ultimately they just could not cope.  In the end Bayern seemed happy to stop any further damage, rather than try to pinch the goal that would give them a lifeline for the second leg in Munich.  This was not the stroll that the final scoreline might suggest. Bayern actually played very well until, like so many before them, they found City simply irresistible.  City had to scrap this out for an hour, former forward Leroy Sane in particular testing his old team-mates, but once they hit their stride they looked every inch a side capable of finally winning the Champions League.  There is many a slip, as they say, and they could yet face last year's nemesis Real Madrid in the last four if they overcome Chelsea, while runaway Serie A leaders Napoli will test anyone.  City, however, will take huge confidence from the manner in which they defended with such fierce determination, while the striker signed to make the difference did exactly that once again.  Erling Haaland's arrival was designed to ensure City got on the right side of the fine margins that have often thwarted them in the Champions League, and he did the job as creator and scorer as they opened up what is surely an unassailable advantage.  He crossed perfectly for Bernardo Silva to head the vital second goal with 20 minutes left then swooped on John Stones' header in trademark fashion for his 45th goal of a remarkable season, a record in all competitions since the Premier League began, surpassing Ruud van Nistelrooy and Mohamed Salah.  Haaland might have been the headline act but plenty of other shared top billing with him on this rain-sodden, windswept Manchester night.  Ruben Dias was back to his outstanding best in defence, Nathan Ake continued his stellar season while Rodri controlled the engine room, aided by Stones in his role stepping out into midfield.  Silva was his waspish self in the forward areas while Jack Grealish's lung-busting effort was personified by the way he pinched possession from Dayot Upamecano in the build-up to the second goal.  The fact that City had to fight this fine Bayern side for supremacy for so long and did so successfully will surely only add to the team's belief that their time has finally come.  City look the complete package, the fear Haaland strikes into opposition defences and his own insatiable appetite for goals giving them an extra cutting edge that may just prove vital.  Guardiola cut an agitated figure throughout, often striding yards outside his technical area to make a point. And while he claimed that these were 90 minutes that had added years to his age, he must surely have come away highly satisfied.  It was night that had its tough times but ultimately turned out pretty much perfectly for Guardiola and City.  City have been favourites for the Champions League before. After this, they will be again. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65247087"},

With a record 14 European titles to their name, how have they continually defied the odds to prove themselves masters of the art of winning in Europe? For many years, especially during the Franco regime, Real Madrid was the country's representative on the world's footballing stage and had to be seen as the very best that Spain could offer.

Fame, power and success are inextricably linked and if you want to stay surrounded by that exalted company, winning becomes an obligation. And that power that permeates every nook and cranny of the Bernabeu is as much a boost to all those that are embraced by it as it is a terrifying weight around the neck of their opponents. Many players and managers have spoken about the \"scenic fear\" of the Real Madrid stadium, a sentence first used by their former player and manager, Jorge Valdano. There is also the perception this \"scenic fear\" helps influence officials when it really matters, on those big occasions where the pressure is huge. The inevitable consequence for the club is that everyone from the top down is very demanding and winning becomes the only philosophy possible. When Real Madrid go shopping they settle for nothing but the very best. The result is a lot of quality and loads of personality. Big match players, most of them with a lot of experience, that can win you the very biggest of games are always the staple of their squad. It is undoubtedly all about substance over style.  They have never been particularly obsessed with any given football style - unlike rivals Barcelona - but rather in taking advantage of that very best talent. \"In Madrid, style has never kept anyone awake. The style is to win... winning was, from the beginning of time, an institutional necessity,\" says Argentine World Cup winner Valdano. \"The essential thing is when a player arrives at Madrid he learns right away that anything short of winning is called a catastrophe. \"The club limits itself to asking them to live up to history. The fans too, and without any kindness. He who bears that pressure is up to the task.\" Those who fail to step up to the plate - and there have been many - will not last long at the club. What awaits new players is a colosseum of a stadium, galleries of pictures representing a who's who of football greats - past and present - and an abundance of trophies on display. It will test their mental resolve and personality from day one.  Those who make it have the thickest of skins. From these sort of characters come the victories, including the most unlikely of results and comebacks that have become their trademark in the Champions League. It is the players that define success or failure at Real Madrid. Former player Victor Sanchez del Amo said that \"Madrid is the best because it empowers the player\". Real Madrid fan and author of \"Forging Glory: A brief history of Real Madrid\", Jesus Bengoechea, wrote: \"With the possible exception of the stages of Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho, there have been hardly any phases in Madrid's history in which the coach has been more important than the players. \"Liverpool's big star is Klopp. The great star of Madrid is anyone but Ancelotti. When things go wrong, the Liverpool player looks at the bench looking for the German, as the City player does looking for Guardiola. \"The Madrid player does not look at his bench when things go wrong. He looks inside himself and remembers why Madrid signed him - because he is amazingly good, because he is the man for that moment and for that place.\" The player looks at the badge on his shirt and does not need reminding that it was worn by the likes of Di Stefano, Gento, Raul, Zidane, Cristiano, Ramos, Benzema, Modric says Bengoechea. \"The simple fact of doing so gives him such a flow of strength that the prophecy is self-fulfilling,\" he added. \"Only the best are worth wearing that shield, ergo I am the best, and through that thought it turns out that this footballer, already very talented, becomes even better.\" Sometimes in this context less is more, going some way to explaining why Real Madrid coaches such as Vincente del Bosque, Zinedine Zidane and Ancelotti have achieved more Champions League success than more demanding rigid examples like Capello and Mourinho. \"There is no Madrid coach who has won the Champions League without, to a certain extent, knowing how to disappear a bit,\" Bengoechea concludes. Speaking to the FC Barcelona coaching staff before the second leg of the Copa del Rey, and mentioning that the Catalan club had beaten their rivals three times in a row, there was a respect, not for what had happened but for what might happen next.  The Catalan coaches kept repeating that Real Madrid can awaken any time and that we have not seen their best this season but they don't need to play well to win the big matches. It smelled of fear factor even within Barcelona. Real Madrid won last season's Champions League after  defeating Liverpool  1-0 in the final. Quite how they managed to get there, and then somehow win it, is another matter altogether. The reality is that - apart from the first leg at Chelsea in the quarter final - this Real Madrid were inferior to every single team they played in the knockout stages up to and including the final. But they found a way to win, pulling off momentous comebacks against both Manchester City and Paris St-Germain on their way to lifting the trophy. Their reputation as comeback kings is far from new, dating back to when Derby came to Madrid in the 1975-76 European Cup with a 4-1 lead only to lose the second leg 5-1 in one of Europe's greatest turnarounds. In the 1984-85 Uefa Cup, a 3-0 win over Inter Milan after a 2-0 defeat in the first leg was followed the next season with a 5-1 win against Borussia Monchengladbach after a 4-0 reversal away in the first leg. They made the final that season with a 2-0 win in the second leg. after losing to Inter 3-1 away. But nothing comes close to last season's exploits, which made a mockery of the form book and fools out of all us so called experts. The belief at Real Madrid from the media, to the fans is they can beat anyone.  Defeats for Barcelona hurt more and last longer. In Madrid, they just forget it and then on the basis of no logic whatsoever constantly talk about an ability to beat whoever is in front of them. That sort of unbeatable mentality gets through to the fans and it does not get damaged when it does not happen. They will do it next time. The difference between the two clubs was summed up by editor of Diario AS, Alfredo Relano, when he said: \"Barca is a sentimental area and Madrid an instrument of conquest\". It is a club where defeat is simply not an option, especially with the type of fan the club has. No player is bigger than the club. Ask anyone who has played there and they will all tell you that no matter who you are, how big a name you might be, if you do not cut the mustard then they will be swift to remind you of your obligations to them and the club. All of the club's big stars have been whistled and jeered at the Bernabeu. No one is exempt. The approach is different to the Anglo-Saxon one and Real Madrid fans are confused as to why fans would want to applaud their side after they had just been on the wrong end of a 5-0 thumping. In the end they are more aligned to those who in the words of Valdano, \"never give up and who in that way pay homage to the history of Real Madrid and to all its legends of the past\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65217286"},
{"title": "Benfica 0-2 Inter Milan: Romelu Lukaku and Nicolo Barella put visitors in strong position", "content": "Romelu Lukaku scored an 82nd-minute penalty as Inter Milan put themselves in a strong position to advance to the semi-finals of the Champions League after a deserved win away to Benfica. Nicolo Barella's downward header gave Inter the lead in the quarter-final first leg in Lisbon. Benfica struggled to dictate play in front of their own fans as Inter produced a defensive masterclass in Lisbon.  Rafa Silva was denied by Andre Onana's first-half save before Inter's Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries produced a crucial block from close range as Benfica pushed for an equaliser. The Italian visitors wrapped up a solid win when substitute Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea, scored from the spot after former Inter player Joao Mario handled. Premier League referee Michael Oliver awarded the penalty after watching the incident on the pitchside monitor, with replays showing the ball struck the side of Mario's head before hitting his hand. Simone Inzaghi's side will fancy their chances of finishing the job in front of their own fans in the return leg on 19 April (20:00 BST). Inter arrived in Portugal's capital on the back of a poor run of form after failing to win any of their past six games. But they took advantage of a hesitant Benfica to take a firm hold of the tie. Barella's goal came after an excellent cross by Alessandro Bastoni, with the Italy midfielder heading it back across the keeper and into the net. It was Inter's first attempt on target but Benfica keeper Odisseas Vlachodimos prevented further damage by saving from former Manchester United and Arsenal player Henrikh Mkhitaryan.  This was Benfica's 13th European game of the season after starting their Champions League campaign at the third qualifying round stage back in August. But they did not create enough and face a mammoth task to turn the tie around after Lukaku wrapped up victory. The Belgium forward had missed out on a starting place to 37-year-old Edin Dzeko but made an impact from the spot after beating the keeper for pace and power. There was still time for Benfica to reduce the deficit but Goncalo Ramos' 89th-minute attempt was kept out by Onana on a memorable night for Inter. \"We cannot think that we are already in the semi-final because we are not,\" Onana said. \"We still need another great game like today's next week. I said that we had to come here and play without fear because we could win - we did just that.\" Romelu Lukaku Formation    4-2-3-1 Formation    3-5-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65233792"},

{"title": "Manchester City 3-0 Bayern Munich: Pep Guardiola's side take control in quarter-finals", "content": "1892 Manchester City took a giant stride towards the Champions League semi-finals with an outstanding performance to overpower Bayern Munich at Etihad Stadium.  Erling Haaland, inevitably, was on target with his 45th goal of the season to make him the highest scorer in all competitions in a single campaign since the Premier League began 30 years ago, surpassing Mohamed Salah and Ruud van Nistelrooy.  City, however, gave a powerful all-round team display and Bayern, under new coach Thomas Tuchel, face a mountainous task to turn this quarter-final around in the second leg at the AllianzArena.  \"Emotionally I'm destroyed,\" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. \"I have aged 10 more years. It was so demanding a game. It was not comfortable. \"Now I have to relax - a day off for the guys, prepare for Leicester [in the Premier League on Saturday].\" Rodri broke the deadlock in spectacular fashion with a curling left-foot drive into the top corner after 27 minutes while Bayern had chances of their own, especially former City forward Leroy Sane, who brought a vital save out of Ederson early in the second half.  City were always a threat and extended their lead with 20 minutes left, Haaland crossing perfectly for Bernardo Silva to head home after Jack Grealish stole possession off Dayot Upemecano.  Haaland was not to be denied himself and he pounced for City's third six minutes later, getting on the end of John Stones' headed knockdown to sweep a finish past Bayern keeper Yann Sommer.  \"It was an incredible result but I know a little bit what can happen in Munich,\" added Guardiola, who managed Bayern Munich from 2013 until 2016, winning three league titles and two domestic doubles. \"If you don't perform really well they are able to score one, two, three. I know that, the players know that. \"It's an incredible result, but we have to do our game with huge, huge personality. If we don't do our game anything can happen. \"To knock out these teams you have to have two good games, not just one.\" Haaland's record breaking will capture the headlines as the 22-year-old Norwegian's voracious appetite for goals shows no sign of being satisfied.  This, however, was much more than a one-man show as Guardiola's side had outstanding performers in all areas as they go in pursuit of the one major trophy that has remained tantalisingly out of reach during the manager's years of huge success at Etihad Stadium.  City have had mishaps before in the Champions League and will face either holders Real Madrid or Chelsea in a potentially hazardous last-four assignment if they complete what should be the formality of the second leg in Munich, but they look in perfect shape.  And in Haaland, they have the goal machine that gives an already outstanding side an added edge amid the fine margins of Europe's elite competition.  They also have a midfield powerhouse in Rodri, whose goal set them on their way, while they defended with real resilience, Nathan Ake continuing an outstanding season with a faultless performance.  Bernardo Silva showed all his creative powers as well as scoring the crucial second goal while Jack Grealish's tireless performance was exemplified by the manner in which he nicked the ball off Upamecano in the build-up to that goal.  Three goals and clean sheet was a fair reward for City's superiority and it will surely now take something extraordinary to stop them taking their place in another semi-final.  Thomas Tuchel declared his delight at being back in England for this Champions League quarter-final, having recently succeed Julian Naglesmann at Bayern Munich, but there was not much else for the former Chelsea manager to be happy about on this rain-sodden Manchester night.  Tuchel's task is to get Bayern back at Europe's top table and his constant agitation in the technical area was an indicator of how big his task is. The Bundesliga is almost taken for granted at Bayern but this fiercely ambitious club wants more and they were well beaten here.  This outstanding coach has proved his quality in the past but he will need to be a miracle worker to get Bayern out of the hole they fell into at Etihad Stadium.  \"I try to not allow my players to focus on the result,\" Tuchel said. \"I think it is not a deserved result, it does not tell the story of this match. \"We played with personality, courage and a lot of quality but we didn't get the rewards we deserved. \"This does not feel a 3-0 but it is a 3-0.

{"title": "Champions League: Pep Guardiola's Manchester City aim to advance in 'most open' competition", "content": "Manchester City aim to take another step closer on Tuesday to the one title that has eluded them - the Champions League. Boss Pep Guardiola says he will be judged on success in the competition but does this year represent their best chance of becoming European champions? \"There's not an outstanding team\" in this season's tournament says pundit Chris Sutton, while football journalist Rory Smith feels the competition is \"not as daunting\" as in previous years.  City, second in the Premier League, will secure a place in the quarter-finals if they win their last-16 second leg at home to RB Leipzig after a  1-1 draw in Germany. Bayern Munich, Chelsea, AC Milan and Benfica are the teams already through, while Real Madrid hold a 5-2 advantage over Liverpool, with Italian sides Napoli and Inter Milan leading after their first-leg matches against Eintracht Frankfurt and Porto respectively. Of the teams left in the competition, only Bayern, Napoli and Benfica are top of their domestic leagues. \"This season is very odd,\" added former Blackburn striker Sutton on  BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. \"If you had a guess who you would make favourites for the Champions League, would we not all say Napoli at the moment? \"But I don't think we've seen Manchester City at their best, that could be ominous, and they find ways to win.  \"It's as open as it's ever been and there's not a really outstanding team where in previous seasons you could argue differently.\" Smith, of the New York Times, added: \"It feels like the field is a bit more open and slightly unfamiliar, and to be honest, better for it. \"Real, City and Bayern are the three established powers and looking how the field is falling will be thinking they are the three outstanding teams. \"City should probably be favourites and will be thinking 'Barcelona aren't there, Liverpool aren't there, Arsenal, the form team in the Premier League, weren't in the competition, it is not quite as daunting as it would be normally'. \"City should be thinking 'this is a really good opportunity to right the wrongs of the last six years'.\" City have won nine major trophies since Guardiola took charge in 2016, but have never been European champions and he was asked whether his spell would be defined by success in Europe's premier cup competition. \"It doesn't mean I agree with it but, absolutely, I'll be judged on that,\" said the 52-year-old Spaniard. \"Before my first game in the Champions League [with City], people said I was here to win it. \"I said 'what?' I don't know, but I accept it. As much as I go through, it's not going to change.\" The closest they have come to Champions League glory was when they reached the 2021 final, where they  lost 1-0 to Chelsea. A  late fightback by Real Madrid  prevented City returning to the final last season, but in Guardiola's first four seasons at Etihad Stadium they failed to progress past the quarter-finals. City were upset by French sides Monaco and Lyon, while suffering agonising exits against Premier League rivals Liverpool and Tottenham, with the latter coming after VAR played a big role in the outcome of a  thrilling second leg at the Etihad. In November, Guardiola, who won the Champions League twice as Barcelona coach,  signed a two-year contract extension to 2025  and said he wanted \"to stay and continue fighting for trophies\". \"We've not won it but we've done really well in the Champions League,\" said City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne. \"I know people base everything on only winning but I feel there's been a lot of circumstances in these kind of games - the Madrid game, the Tottenham game where we deserved to go through but didn't. These are moments in games where these things happen. \"Obviously I want to win it but I know that, as long as we don't, I'll come here and get the same questions and I'm fine because people judge you on that. \"We just try to win these games and be the best people and team we can be.\" De Bruyne has registered 17 assists in 34 appearances this season, three more than the two-time Premier League player of the season managed in 45 games last term. But Guardiola has started the Belgium midfielder on the bench in four of City's past nine top-flight games and has told the 31-year-old to focus on the \"simple things\" to get back to his best. \"It's been a difficult season for all of us, me included, [because of] the World Cup and many things,\" said Guardiola. \"I'm not going to discover Kevin. Kevin has an ability to do it. What I'd like - I spoke many times to him - is [for him] to go to the easy principles and do it well. \"He has an incredible ability to make an assist, to score goals and see passes like no-one else, but I always have belief they will increase and will get better when [players do] the simple things... \"When the simple things are done perfectly and we are in the right moment, the actions to create incredible passes that he - only he - can find, it will be easier, it will be better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64943870"},

The Algeria midfielder struck home from the edge of the area after Braham Diaz broke superbly on the halfway line. Napoli had Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa sent off in the second half and were well held by an organised Milan.  Milan also came close to a second goal when Simon Kjaer's header bounced off the underside of the bar. Napoli, in the Champions League last eight for the first time, were straight out of the traps, demonstrating a belief that comes from being 16 points clear at the top of Serie A. Georgia winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had their best chance of the game in the opening minute after a poor clearance fell at his feet, but his effort from eight yards out was blocked on the line. Napoli, the highest scorers in the competition this season, continued to push, with former Fulham midfielder Anguissa and Piotr Zielinski having efforts tipped over the bar.  Milan, who  won 4-0 at Napoli  10 days ago in Serie A, weathered the storm and then grew into the game as Portugal winger Rafael Leao broke forward from his own half and slid an effort inches wide of the far post. The 40th-minute winner was sparked by former Manchester City youth product Diaz, who showed great skill to let the ball run and turned to take two Napoli midfielders out of the game. Bennacer, who played once in two years for Arsenal, then met Leao's cut-back with a left-footed finish, which was helped into the roof of the net by the outstretched foot of visiting goalkeeper Alex Meret.  Milan's Danish defender Kjaer was extremely unlucky with his powerful first-half stoppage-time header bouncing about a yard from the line after it struck the bar. The second half was scrappy, with chances at a premium, but Anguissa earned two yellow cards in less than four minutes. The first was for pulling down Theo Hernandez as the Frenchman looked to hit Napoli on the counter, before Anguissa caught the Milan left-back again with a high boot in the 74th minute. Napoli will also be without defender Kim Min-jae for the second leg, which takes place next Tuesday, after he was booked for dissent in a frustrating second period.  Despite being a man down, though, Napoli almost found a late equaliser but Mike Maignan did superbly to claw Giovanni di Lorenzo's effort behind for a corner. \"It is so important to have a positive result,\" Milan forward Diaz, named man of the match, told BT Sport. \"Not conceding a goal was great.

{"title": "Tottenham 0-0 AC Milan (0-1 agg): 'End of Antonio Conte's reign surely a formality'", "content": "2037 When the final whistle sounded in the goalless draw that confirmed Tottenham Hotspur's exit at the last-16 stage of the Champions League, every sight and sound screamed the beginning of the end of manager Antonio Conte's 16-month reign.  Spurs fans reacted furiously, the body language reflected a broken team, the empty seats illustrated the brutal reality of the discontent that bubbled beneath the surface throughout what should have been a full-blooded and furious attempt to rescue their European aspirations against AC Milan. The ramifications of  this defeat over two legs  may be felt far and wide at Spurs, but it was the manner of the performance that will bring justifiable criticism down on Conte's head, his eventual exit now surely a formality, whether it comes at the end of the season or before.  There is no indication he is willing to renew a contract that expires at the end of this campaign, and just as significantly no sign that Spurs are desperate for him to sign one.  It just seems a matter of time before Conte leaves.  His approach and the passive, conservative gameplan of the first 45 minutes sucked the life out of a Spurs support who had built up a superb atmosphere before kick-off. Instead, they sat back and allowed Milan to settle into their task.  In sharp contrast to the positive mindset adopted by Graham Potter's Chelsea when faced with a similar assignment against Borussia Dortmund at Stamford Bridge 24 hours earlier, Spurs played as if they were blissfully unaware that they actually had to score a goal to stay in the Champions League.  Spurs' motto 'To Dare Is To Do' was flouted spectacularly. No daring. No doing. And out they went.  The reaction at the end left Conte and his players in no doubt about how Spurs fans felt, and who could blame them? Where was the urgency? Where was the intensity? Where was the creativity?  Conte's team lacked midfield spark. Son Heung-min was poor while Harry Kane was starved of serious service, though he almost rescued Spurs and sent the game into extra time, only to be denied by Mike Maignan's magnificent save.  It would have been an undeserved reprieve for Conte and Spurs, because nothing about their performance merited any opportunity to secure a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.  The midfield duo of Oliver Skipp and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg never lacked endeavour, but they could not provide the sort of supply line which would trouble Milan and allow Kane, in particular, to thrive.  This now has all the hallmarks of a managerial reign that is coming to a loveless conclusion unless Conte can inspire Spurs into the Premier League's top four - which will be unlikely if they show this lack of ambition and could have even more fallout further down the line.  The whispers have already started that Kane may consider his future if Spurs are not in the Champions League next season. This defeat condemned the 29-year-old club-record goalscorer to another season without a trophy.  Spurs' night was summed up by the behaviour of defender Cristian Romero, a walking yellow card who then turned it into a red one with a ridiculous late challenge on Theo Hernandez.  Romero may be a World Cup winner with Argentina but his villainous hard-man act is wearing thin, senseless being a generous way to describe the wild launch that reduced Spurs to 10 men for the last 12 minutes. It was the act of a liability.  Spurs fans were given plenty of opportunity to vent their frustrations, whether it was the aimless passing, the tediously slow build-up, the hopeful long balls or the substitution of the popular Dejan Kulusevski for Davinson Sanchez - this was a thoroughly dire night all round.  There is still a Champions League place up for grabs. Spurs are fourth but Liverpool look increasingly ominous right behind, three points adrift with a game in hand. There is no question which team has the greater forward momentum.  No matter how uncertain the future looks for Conte, Spurs must somehow put this whimper of a Champions League departure behind them quickly or even that consolation could be pushed beyond them very swiftly.  The overriding feeling, apart from the unrelenting misery and the disappointment of Spurs' performance and results, is that the countdown to the Italian's departure is now under way. The clock is surely ticking on Conte's tenure as Tottenham manager after a truly dismal Champions League exit at the hands of AC Milan in front of their own furious fans.

{"title": "Paris St-Germain out of Champions League: Time to rip up project?", "content": "896 Paris St-Germain's 11th consecutive attempt at winning the Champions League ended in more misery - so is it time for them to \"rip it all up\" and start again? Bayern Munich dumped them out in the first knockout round 3-0 on aggregate, with  Wednesday's 2-0 win in Germany sealing the victory. A team with the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar, who was injured for the second leg, and Kylian Mbappe - as well as arguably the greatest player in the history of football, Lionel Messi, failed to score over 180 minutes. \"The Paris St-Germain project was built to win the Champions League and they've been miles off it. It ultimately looks like it's going to be a failure,\" said former Chelsea playmaker Joe Cole on BT Sport. Ex-England midfielder Owen Hargreaves said: \"They have so many brilliant individuals. It's not a team. It's a shame. They've put so many fabulous players together but if anything, they're going backwards.\" PSG manager Christophe Galtier said: \"It's a big disappointment. We have to deal with it and accept it.  \"I don't know if it's a lesson to be learned, but there's a lot of frustration. If we'd scored first, it would have been different, but we didn't.\" PSG have spent over £1bn since a Qatari takeover in 2012 and have won eight of the 10 Ligue 1 titles and 12 domestic cups under the new ownership. But the Champions League was the owners' dream and looks no closer to fruition. After reaching the quarter-final in each of the first four seasons, they have gone out in the last 16 in five of the last seven seasons. The outlier was the 2020 final they lost to Bayern. Their squads have frequently been top heavy with superstar attacking talent - but not enough solidity or balance. Cole said: \"They lack an identity. What are they? It's all off the cuff. There doesn't seem to be a plan. They're a scarred team. Over the last four years they've gone out in good positions and it's left a mark on their psyche as a club. \"They've bought some of the best players of the last 20 years. The young French players scattered around Europe could be doing what these lads are doing for a quarter of the cost with an identity the fans connect with.\" Kingsley Coman, who scored Bayern's winner in the 2020 final and also in the first leg of this tie, is a Parisian who left PSG on a free transfer in 2014. Another player to leave PSG for free was Cameroon striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - and he scored Bayern's first goal on Tuesday. Former Bayern midfielder Hargreaves said: \"PSG should rip the whole project up and start from scratch. They have the best young talent pool in all the world from Paris. \"Why are they going to Salzburg or Dortmund or Leicester? They should all be playing for PSG.  \"They could win Ligue 1 with those players then sprinkle in one or two superstars.\" Mbappe has been one of the most successful PSG signings, moving from Monaco for £165m in 2017, and becoming the top scorer in their history last weekend with 201 goals in 248 games. The 2018 World Cup winner is one of the few Parisians in their team but may feel he has to leave to establish himself as one of the game's greats. \"Mbappe has another year on his contract and even if he wants to leave they will not let it happen so he will still be there,\" said French journalist Julien Laurens. \"He hasn't won the Champions League but he is only 24 so this is not an obsession for him. He said it would be extra special to be the first one to win it for PSG.\" One player who is out of contract this summer is Messi. The 35-year-old Argentina captain is thought to be interested in staying but has not signed a new deal yet. He has won a record seven Ballons d'Or and scored 29 goals in 64 games for PSG since leaving Barcelona two summers ago - but he has failed to be the catalyst for the elusive Champions League crown. \"They are still talking about Messi's contract with the club but tonight he wasn't good enough,\" said Laurens.  \"It isn't his talent that is in question but at his age he is on the counter-attack and Leon Goretzka catches him up from five yards behind. I don't think he is good enough for this level anymore.\" Brazil forward Neymar, 31, left Barcelona - where he was in Messi's shadow - for PSG in 2017 for a world-record £200m. His time with the club has been plagued by injuries, and his season was prematurely ended last week with the news he needed ankle surgery. \"They tried to sell him last year so they will try to do that again,\" said Laurens. Former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman said on BT Sport: \"PSG aren't going to get any better next year.  \"Lionel Messi will be a year older, Sergio Ramos likewise. Neymar can't keep fit at the latter end of seasons. Marquinhos is getting on. The big players are going to have to move on.\" Galtier is the sixth appointment of the Qatari regime and, like the other five, has failed to deliver the Champions League. Two of the previous five - Carlo Ancelotti and Thomas Tuchel - have gone on to win Europe's top trophy after leaving. Galtier, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino in the summer, is one of only two managers to stop PSG winning the French title in the last decade, when he led Lille to 2021 glory. They are eight points clear of Marseille at the top, so are likely to add another Ligue 1 trophy to the cabinet. \"The next few days are going to be crucial. I think Galtier will see out the season and hopefully they win the league,\" said Laurens. \"I wouldn't expect him to be here at the start of the next season.\" Ex-Everton defender Joleon Lescott said: \"Some of the best coaches in world football have gone there and not been able to find a solution.  \"Tuchel was the closest but came up short.

{"title": "Bayern Munich 2-0 Paris St-Germain (3-0 agg): Hosts cruise into Champions League quarter-finals", "content": "269 Bayern Munich cruised into the quarter-finals of the Champions League as they condemned Paris St-Germain to another last-16 exit. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting swept home just after the hour mark for the hosts against his former club, with substitute Serge Gnabry adding the gloss to a professional display late on. PSG have now been eliminated from the competition at this stage in five of their previous seven campaigns and this represented another dismal failure for the Ligue 1 leaders and their under-pressure head coach Christophe Galtier. Despite boasting a collection of stars, the Parisians not only failed to score over two legs but were saved the embarrassment of a four or five-goal aggregate defeat by a VAR decision and offside flag ruling out an earlier Choupo-Moting header and Sadio Mane's stoppage-time effort. Six-time European champions Bayern had begun the evening nervously defending a one-goal first-leg lead and guarding against the dual threat posed by Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi.  However, while PSG's star forward line sporadically threatened early on neither was given the time or space to inflict any damage on a disciplined and efficient Bayern side, who ran out comfortable winners. The only major concern for the German champions arrived in the first period and was entirely self-inflicted.   Goalkeeper Yann Sommer - who was caught in possession by Achraf Hakimi - presented visiting midfielder Vitinha with an open goal but defender Matthijs de Ligt made a superb sliding intervention for the home side. The draw for the last eight of the competition takes place on 17 March in Nyon, Switzerland. Sommer's mistake should have been punished and provided PSG with the momentum to go on and win the tie, in the same manner  that Real Madrid  did against them almost exactly 12 months ago. However, Vitinha's weak finish was symptomatic of a side that has promised much but too often failed to deliver on big European nights - and who failed to score in a knockout tie for the first time since the 1994-95 semi-finals against AC Milan. Sergio Ramos and Mbappe both saw second-half efforts well saved by Swiss international Sommer but by then the damage had been done and Bayern were in the ascendancy.  The German side's control and strength in reserve was also underlined by their changes with Julian Nagelsmann able to introduce Gnabry, Mane, Joao Cancelo and Leroy Sane while bringing off the likes of Thomas Muller and the impressive Jamal Musiala. The impact of Portugal international Cancelo - who is on loan at Bayern from Manchester City - was immediate, as he laid on a goal for Gnabry within three minutes of his introduction to put the tie beyond doubt.

{"title": "Pep Guardiola on Julia Roberts, Erling Haaland and the 'Twitter guys'", "content": "It is a measure of the way Pep Guardiola's mind works that the Manchester City boss can start a post-match news conference talking about his star striker scoring five goals, take aim at the social media critics of his selections and end by lamenting a trip to Old Trafford more than six years ago by his \"idol\" Julia Roberts. But that was Guardiola at Etihad Stadium an hour after his side had beaten RB Leipzig 7-0. Even his normally chatty media officer was left virtually speechless at the unexpected direction Guardiola's thought process had taken him. We might have guessed he was in a playful mood from his initial reaction to being asked to talk through Haaland's performance. \"Five goals...\" he said.  Eventually, he added a bit more: \"The problem for this guy is if he doesn't score two or three goals he will be criticised.\" Guardiola appeared to be articulating something that had long been bothering him. He was then asked if Haaland, who has now scored 39 goals this season, was the player who could finally turn City into Champions League winners. \"Always we have scored goals in the Champions League,\" he countered. \"We scored four against Madrid, six against Monaco, four against Tottenham.  \"The problem is not scoring goals, it is conceding stupid goals.\"  It was after that Guardiola trained his sights on those who have been carping about the absence of Phil Foden at times, or Kevin de Bruyne, or Riyad Mahrez, or anyone who was not in his starting XI on any given day, and why he plays four central defenders, as he did on Tuesday evening with John Stones and Nathan Ake occupying the full-back berths. \"With the selection, if we win I am right, if we lose I am wrong,\" he said.  \"But I have a lot of information even you [the media] don't have.  \"Bernardo on the left side is amazing. Bernardo has the ability to press three players in two movements. No player in the world can do that. He is so intelligent. Leipzig are very good on the left side. That's why he played. \"I have more info than the Twitter guys. I am sorry. Today I am right. I am right.\" Now Guardiola was on a roll. Anyone asking a question could forget about getting a serious answer. A journalist who had spoken to Haaland and been told the Norwegian would have liked to stay on the pitch to try and become the first player to score six goals in a Champions League game got this: \"If he achieves this milestone at 22, his life would be boring. Now he has a target to do it in the future.\" Which brings us to Roberts. The Pretty Woman star is part of the same agency as former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho. Her children are known to be big football fans. In November 2016, she went to Old Trafford with her family to watch United play West Ham and was pictured on the pitch afterwards. Guardiola had been at City five months at the time. He has waited six and a half years to tell his story. \"I have three idols in my life,\" he said. \"Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Julia Roberts. \"Julia Roberts years ago came to Manchester, not in the period of Alex Ferguson when they were winning title after title, in the last four or five years when we were better than them. But she didn't come to see us. She went to visit Man United. \"Even if I win the Champions League, it will not [ease] the disappointment of Julia Roberts going to United. My idol.\" I don't think he was being serious.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64960349"},
{"title": "Tottenham 0-0 AC Milan (0-1 agg): Spurs out of Champions League after shutout", "content": "1715 Tottenham Hotspur's Champions League campaign ended in bitterly disappointing fashion as they failed to overturn a first-leg deficit in the last 16 against AC Milan.  Spurs paid the price for another passive start that allowed Milan to settle into their task - the misery complete when defender Cristian Romero was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for a wild challenge on Theo Hernandez.  Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tested AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan with a powerful second-half shot and Harry Kane headed wide, but Spurs failed to mount sustained pressure on the Italian defence.  A late Kane header was brilliantly kept out by Maignan before Divock Origi struck the post for the visitors as Spurs went out tamely, their season now resting on the battle for a top-four place in the Premier League.  Spurs fans reacted angrily as their Champions League campaign came to a conclusion and their discontent was understandable after such a dismal performance.  The lack of urgency that has marked so much of their season has never been more stark than in the first 45 minutes when Spurs played as if they were barely aware they needed to score to keep their ambitions alive.  Manager Antonio Conte  returned to the technical area  after recuperating from gallbladder surgery but this did not spare him the wrath of the Spurs support mystified by such a conservative approach.  He was not helped by Romero's red card for a late, reckless tackle on Hernandez, having already received a first-half caution for a clumsy challenge to prevent Rafael Leao breaking clear. Kane almost rescued Spurs and sent the game into extra time with that late header, but for most of the night he was starved of meaningful service in a side largely devoid of creativity.  What this means for Conte's long-term future remains to be seen, with growing uncertainty surrounding his position and his contract up at the end of the season.  Spurs now have only that top-four place to fight for, and on this form you would not back them to achieve it. They have scrambled through much of this season despite indifferent form but there was to be no reprieve here - and they did not deserve one.  Fikayo Tomori has slipped out of the England reckoning, but his calm and measured performance was a timely reminder of the qualities he can offer should manager Gareth Southgate require them.  The 25-year-old  former Chelsea defender  has matured in Serie A and was a rock in the Milan defence here - strong in the air, showing impeccable timing with his tackles and calm on the ground.  Spurs hardly subjected Milan to intense scrutiny, but when needed Tomori was excellent and a key figure as they reached the quarter-finals.  Milan were also well-served by keeper Maignan, faultless throughout and producing a moment of brilliance to keep out Kane in the closing seconds.  Spurs can have no complaints over the two legs, with Milan probably surprised by the absence of intensity in front of a home crowd waiting for the opportunity to roar their side on.

{"title": "Real Madrid 'demolish' Liverpool in Champions League thriller to make themselves 'favourites'", "content": "\"We want this Champions League again,\" said Karim Benzema after masters of Europe Real Madrid produced another magic night to become \"favourites\" for a 15th crown.  At 2-0 down to Liverpool within 14 minutes at a jubilant Anfield, many teams would have crumbled - but Vinicius Jr scored twice, Eder Militao powered in a header and then Benzema claimed two goals as  Real won 5-2. No away team had ever scored more than three goals at Anfield in a European tie. Nobody had ever come from two goals down to win a Champions League game by three. Real is the Spanish word for royal and Madrid are true European royalty. They have won 14 European Cups, including five in the past nine seasons. Two of those final successes were against Jurgen Klopp's Reds. \"We played with personality, we produced goals - we want this Champions League again,\" said Benzema. \"And that produced a match which was lovely to play in and for those who were watching. \"After those first 15 minutes we saw the true Real Madrid. Football at this level is hard. They started better than us but this was a big game and we were ready.\" Newcastle and England legend Alan Shearer, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, was hugely impressed. \"Real Madrid don't panic,\" he said. \"They have been in situations like this before and they believe their pedigree will get them through. It has been incredible, unbelievable - because of their experience and knowhow, Real got themselves back into the game. \"Real Madrid have just demolished Liverpool. You have seen a masterclass in how not to panic. It would take a brave man to bet against Real Madrid. Absolutely they can win it - yes.  \"They are a club with huge experience. They have seen it all and done it all. They know what they have to do.\" Adam Lallana, now at Brighton, played for Liverpool in the 2018 final in Kyiv which Real won 3-1. \"I was in awe watching Real Madrid. This team is evolving. It felt like I was watching the favourites of the competition,\" he said. In La Liga, Real are eight points behind Barcelona - who did not even make it out of their Champions League group. But Carlo Ancelotti's side are always a different beast in Europe. Dramatic comebacks were the theme of their success last season. They trailed Paris St-Germain 2-0 in the last 16, were behind against Chelsea with 10 minutes to go in the quarter-finals and in the semis they needed two goals in the final minute from Rodrygo to catch Manchester City before winning in extra time. In the first leg of that City game, in Manchester, they were 2-0 down after 11 minutes and lost 4-3. \"Obviously we didn't expect to start like we did but at 2-0 down I thought about the City away leg last year in the hope that we could do the same,\" said Ancelotti. \"But it turned out even better. \"Liverpool are a great team which made us suffer in the first half so I'd say that, unfortunately, this tie isn't finished.\" Real's team is a mix of youth and experience.  Five of the them who played at Anfield have won five European Cups - Benzema, Dani Carvajal, Nacho, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos (who won one of his five with Bayern Munich). Only one player in history - Real legend Paco Gento - has won more, with six from 1956 to 1966. Benzema (six) and Vinicius (five) have scored more goals in the Champions League or European Cup against Liverpool than any player. Benzema netted in the 2018 final with Vinicius scoring the only goal at Stade de France in May. Vinicius is only 22 years old. \"I think that, right now, Vinicius Junior is the most decisive player anywhere in the world - the one who determines matches most on a consistent basis,\" said Ancelotti after this latest win. Klopp concurred. \"Vinicius is one of the best players in the world,\" he said. The Brazilian is Real's top scorer in all competitions with 16 goals this season. Current Ballon d'Or winner Benzema is next on 14. At 35, he became the oldest visiting player to score at Anfield in Europe. Former Reds midfielder Steven Gerrard said on BT Sport: \"Benzema is one of the best players I have ever seen at drawing players out. He's one of the best players in the world by a mile.\" Former England defender Rio Ferdinand called the Frenchman \"the most complete number nine I have ever seen\". Real midfielder Modric also caught the eye at Anfield. \"To play like that at 37 is incredible,\" said Lallana, 34. \"We are talking about true greatness here,\" said Gerrard. \"Modric and Benzema perform on a completely different level from most players.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64723649"},

{"title": "Manchester City 7-0 RB Leipzig (8-1 agg): Erling Haaland scores five as City cruise into quarter-finals", "content": "1987 Erling Haaland rewrote the record books by scoring an incredible five times as Manchester City swept RB Leipzig aside to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Haaland becomes the fastest and youngest player to reach 30 goals in Europe's elite club competition. He is also the youngest player to score five times in a single Champions League game, joining Argentina great Lionel Messi and Brazil forward Luiz Adriano as the only players to do so. The 22-year-old is now on 39 goals for the season in all competitions, the first City player to reach that figure in a single campaign. His five hat-tricks are three more than any other player in the big five leagues. On any normal day, Ilkay Gundogan's precise low shot into the bottom corner would have merited praise. On this historic night, which matched City's 7-0 triumph over Schalke in 2019, it was nothing more than a footnote. On this evidence, no-one, not even Real Madrid, will want to be paired with Pep Guardiola's side in Friday's last-eight draw.  Legendary former club captain Vincent Kompany can only hope his old club have got this calibre of performance out of their system when he brings his Burnley side to Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup on Saturday. Leipzig coach Marco Rose was Haaland's boss at Dortmund last season. Little wonder he reacted with incredulity on the eve of the game when it was pointed out to him that some feel City are a lesser team with the Norwegian in it. \"It could get really, really, really good for him with Pep and Man City,\" was Rose's response. He would have preferred his words not to be proved quite so perceptive, quite so soon. Leipzig were given a very early warning about the difficulties that lay ahead when Nathan Ake dropped a long pass over their defence and in the space of half a dozen strides Haaland had sprinted clear of their defence and bore down on goal. Goalkeeper Janis Blaswich managed to deny Haaland the opener - but it was to be his last success of the night in that personal duel. Rose may argue City should not have been awarded the penalty that gave Haaland the chance to open the scoring. True, Benjamin Henrichs was very close to Rodri - but once VAR intervened it was also obvious the defender had his arms out when the City man headed the ball against his hand.  Haaland kept his cool, buried the penalty and, as the visiting bench were still grumbling at the unfairness of it all, made it 2-0 when he reacted quickest after De Bruyne's thunderous shot came back off the crossbar and headed into an empty net. And when Amadou Haidara's clearance off the line, after Blaswich had turned away Ruben Dias' header, bounced straight into the advancing Haaland to give him his hat-trick in first-half stoppage time, Leipzig might have been tempted to concede. But there was more punishment to come for the hapless visitors. Gundogan's well-taken strike was followed by Haaland's fourth, which came when Blaswich saved a Manuel Akanji effort and again it fell just right for the Norwegian. When he turned home a fifth for the first time in his career, Haaland had effectively scored five times in 35 minutes. Hs dad Alfie, watching from an executive box high in the stadium, was on his feet leading the applause. Probably wisely, Guardiola decided there was not much point in Haaland staying on the pitch. He left to a standing ovation from a crowd both appreciative and incredulous at what they had just seen. City eased off with the job emphatically done before De Bruyne scored with virtually the last kick as Leipzig were condemned to their heaviest European defeat.

The Italian side won 1-0 in the first leg  at the San Siro and were able to frustrate their opponents in Portugal. In a frantic finish, Mehdi Taremi hit the post and then the crossbar in injury time for Porto, who also had Brazilian winger Pepe sent off. Away goalkeeper Andre Onana also made a number of key saves as Inter held on. Porto, second in the Primeira Liga, were without 40-year-old Portugal defender Pepe, a three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, while midfielder Otavio was suspended after his red card for two bookable offences in the first leg. The hosts had the best chances in the first half but Onana made a fine save to keep out Mateus Uribe's 25-yard strike. Taremi also curled a shot wide, Evanilson saw his effort blocked by Federico Dimarco's excellent sliding challenge and Stephen Eustaquio was unable to get a touch on an inviting low cross. Uribe fired a volley over in the second half, Onana denied Marko Grujic and Inter's Denzel Dumfries cleared a shot off the line but the home side could not make the breakthrough as Inter defended excellently. Edin Dzeko had the visitors' best opportunity with a low, angled strike but was denied by home goalkeeper Diogo Costa.

{"title": "Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool (6-2 agg): Reds dumped out of Champions League", "content": "2870 Liverpool's Champions League hopes ended at the hands of Real Madrid for a third consecutive season as they failed to overcome their first-leg Anfield demolition. The Reds, who lost the first leg 5-2, lined up with four forwards at the Bernabeu as they looked to add another famous comeback to their fabled European history. But that rarely looked on the cards and legendary Real striker Karim Benzema put the tie beyond doubt when he tucked in from Vinicius Jr's cutback late on. Jurgen Klopp's side would have lost this game by more if not for Alisson. The Reds goalkeeper denied Vinicius and Eduardo Camavinga with magnificent first-half stops. If Darwin Nunez had taken a chance in the sixth minute, then it could have been a different story. Liverpool players walked off to 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on the Bernabeu speakers as they reflected on their biggest ever aggregate Champions League defeat. The Reds were beaten finalists against Real last summer but now face a battle to even be in the tournament next season, sitting six points behind the Champions League places. One downside for Carlo Ancelotti's Real was Benzema hurting himself while scoring and having to be replaced. However afterwards the striker said he will be fine for Sunday's must-win El Clasico with Barcelona. This was the 92nd time a team have lost by three or more goals in the first leg at home in a European Cup tie. All 92 have been eliminated. Data analysts Gracenote gave Liverpool a 3.92% probability of progression and Jurgen Klopp talked about a \"1% chance\" beforehand. That was the challenge they faced after Madrid put on an exhibition of taking their chances at Anfield. But still, this is Liverpool and this is the Champions League.  In 2005 they came from 3-0 down to beat Ancelotti's Milan in the Champions League final. Three years ago they lost 3-0 to Barcelona and won the second leg 4-0, although crucially that was at home. Liverpool gave it a go - they had to - with forwards Diogo Jota, Nunez, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo in their line-up. Had Nunez scored after six minutes instead of shooting at Thibaut Courtois, who knows what might have happened. The Uruguayan forced another two saves from the goalkeeper, most notably with a fine curling effort after cutting in from the left wing. But really they were lucky to only lose this leg 1-0. There was no gung-ho, 'heavy metal', blockbuster attempt to go and win it. They did not even have a shot between James Milner's blocked effort in the 37th minute and Harvey Elliott's attempt on target after 82 minutes. It could have got slightly worse in injury time when referee Felix Zwayer went to the monitor to see if Konstantinos Tsimikas had handled the ball, but the decision was no penalty to Real. So just like in last year's final in Paris, and the previous season's quarter-final, Real were Liverpool's conquerors. The Reds will undoubtedly finish this season trophy-less and it will be a huge blow to their future plans if they cannot overtake Newcastle and Tottenham to finish fourth in the Premier League come the end of the season. Ancelotti said beforehand that psychologically \"it's tougher for us than Liverpool\" because the Reds knew they had to go \"all out from the first minute\". But it was Real who had the bulk of the chances. They had 17 shots here, compared to the nine efforts that yielded five goals on Merseyside. Alisson somehow saved Vinicius' close-range volley with an outstretched arm. Then he tipped Camavinga's deflected, looping long-range strike on to the crossbar. Luka Modric drilled a shot just over from outside the box. After the break Alisson denied Federico Valverde and Benzema in quick succession. Valverde was unmarked when he headed another chance over. Eventually the pressure told when Benzema slotted in from Vinicius' ball as they got in behind the Reds' defence. That was his seventh Champions League goal against the Reds, a record for any player. Benzema said he took a kick to the shin but will be fit for Sunday's trip to the Nou Camp. Real need a win to keep their La Liga title hopes alive, as they trail leaders Barcelona by nine points. But for now the 14-time European champions can deservedly celebrate reaching a 19th Champions League quarter-final.

The victory gives Napoli a big advantage for the return leg in Italy on Wednesday, 15 March.

{"title": "RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City: Erling Haaland quiet as Pep Guardiola's side held", "content": "After watching his side held to a second successive  1-1 draw,  this time in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with RB Leipzig, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola offered a novel solution to the visitors' struggles to score more. \"Maybe in the second leg I will be crazy and play with nine strikers,\" he joked. Guardiola may have appeared in a positive mood after the game in Germany - and an away draw in a European knockout game is certainly not a result to be sniffed at - but it will likely still frustrate him that his side have not turned their recent dominance into more goals. At the weekend they dropped two points in the Premier League title race after a first-half opener for City was cancelled out by a second-half equaliser by Nottingham Forest - and it was the same story at RB Leipzig. City had been in total control in the opening 45 minutes yet only had Riyad Mahrez's goal to show for it. \"You expect us to come here and win 0-5? That is not a reality,\" Guardiola told BT Sport after the game.  \"This is a competition that in the group stage many important teams are out. It is difficult. We are a good team and we do many, many good things. We continued to do this.  \"People expect us to come here and win 4-0, I am sorry we are not able to do this.\" City's hopes of scoring more than the one goal were not helped by a quiet display from Erling Haaland. The striker, who missed a number of chances at Forest, had just seven touches of the ball in the first half and none of those were in the opposition penalty box. Haaland, usually so deadly with the few chances he gets, had a real opportunity to add a second for City after the break but dragged his shot well wide.  The Norway international has five goals in five Champions League games for Guardiola's side this season, and has 32 overall, so of course is allowed the odd quiet game, but this was a particularly anonymous one. By the end he had had 20 touches of the ball and just one shot on goal. Mahrez, who scored his 20th goal in the Champions League, defended the work of his team-mate. \"He is a fast, powerful attacker and we know his qualities,\" he said. \"It's not up to him to win, to go get the ball. He's not there to have 70 touches every game.\" Former Arsenal defending Matthew Upson, who was watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, said: \"You can't say he doesn't do his job when you look at the numbers. I know he didn't score tonight, but that's his role, that's how they play.  \"His manager seems happy with it and he seems happy that he's scoring loads of goals and going to be breaking records in terms of that.\" As the game wore on and a winner for City - who were unfortunate not to have been awarded a late penalty for handball - looked increasingly unlikely, it seemed unusual that Guardiola did not turn to his bench. It is the first time a side has not made any substitutions in a Champions League match since Manchester United against Juventus in October 2018 under Jose Mourinho. With a number of attacking options available to him including Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez, Guardiola had players who could make a difference, but he didn't see the need to mix things up. \"I saw the team was good, especially in the middle,\" he added. \"In the end I decided to continue with what I had.\" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport: \"You want to get on the pitch and play football, especially when you think you are the person who can affect this game, unlock this team. \"But at the same time you have to respect Pep. All of the players, especially in the attacking areas of the pitch, have these moments - so you have to be patient, trust the process.\" Given City's formidable record on home soil - they have won 17 of 19 games at the Etihad Stadium this season - City will rightly feel confident of getting the job done in the return leg on Tuesday, 14 March. At full-time on Wednesday, Guardiola gathered his players in a huddle to remind them they had plenty to be positive about. \"I said 'why you have your heads down?

Fans were penned in and teargassed outside Stade de France as kick-off was delayed by 36 minutes. \"We should be ensuring the voices of fans are listened to,\" said Andrew.  An  independent report  published this month said Uefa bears \"primary responsibility\" for the chaotic scenes. Uefa apologised to Liverpool fans after it initially blamed them for creating the disorder by arriving late for the final against Real Madrid, and in some cases with counterfeit tickets. \"It is vital that lessons are learned from this near-disaster and action is taken to prevent it from happening again,\" said Andrew.  \"Uefa has recognised that they made a series of mistakes in their handling of the event and have apologised to fans who attended.\" Andrew said his department have asked Uefa to outline how they will respond to recommendations made in the independent report. \"I welcome Uefa's commitment to implement those recommendations, their engagement with fans' groups last week and the further apology offered by their general secretary,\" Andrew said. \"It's vital Uefa continues this dialogue with supporter organisations and that an action plan is published as quickly as possible.\" Andrew said Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer will meet France's sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera \"in the coming weeks\" to discuss the French government's response to the independent review after they stood with Uefa in blaming Liverpool fans for the chaos. Labour MP Ian Byrne, a survivor of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster who also attended the final in Paris, said it is important fans \"have a voice\" around the organisation of the 2024 final. \"They're [fans] the ones that go to matches, they're the ones that have got the experience. They don't get listened to enough,\" he said. \"We didn't get listened to in Paris. Lots of times our voices aren't heard.\"Byrne added: \"We need the FA to provide leadership and show courage to ensure that our demands regarding Paris are met in the halls of Uefa.\" Byrne urged the UK government to \"keep the political pressure\" on French president Emmanuel Macron and Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin to \"ensure a full apology is made and the recommendations of the report are met\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64799933"},
{"title": "RB Leipzig 1-1 Manchester City: Riyad Mahrez scores but Pep Guardiola's side held", "content": "1180 Manchester City paid the price for failing to make the most of their first-half dominance as they were held to a draw by RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. The away side were in complete control in the first 45 minutes and got the breakthrough midway through the half when Ilkay Gundogan pounced on a mistake in defence and fed Riyad Mahrez to drive into the back of the net. But RB Leipzig came out in the second half with more ambition and twice went close to equalising early on through Benjamin Henrichs, who first headed just over before then sweeping wide with just Ederson to beat. The Manchester City goalkeeper was called upon again to deny Andre Silva at his near post but the hosts were finally rewarded for their mounting pressure when Josko Gvardiol headed in following a short corner. Janis Blaswich denied Gundogan from restoring the visitors' lead moments later with a reflex save from close range, while City had a penalty shout denied late on when Henrichs appeared to handle inside the area, but Leipzig held on to secure a draw. City, bidding to end their wait for a first Champions League trophy, will look to get the job done in the return leg on Tuesday, 14 March. An away draw in the knockout stage of Europe should be considered a very decent result, but City boss Pep Guardiola will likely be frustrated that his side failed to once again make their first-half dominance count. They had gone into the game looking to respond after they were held by Nottingham Forest at the weekend, once again conceding in the second half after scoring before the break. They controlled proceedings in the early stages of this game as Leipzig rarely ventured beyond their own half and once Mahrez scored it seemed only a question of how many more goals City would score. But despite their possessional dominance, City found it hard to create too many chances, not helped by the absence of Kevin de Bruyne through illness.  Erling Haaland struggled to make an impact on his return to Germany, but really should have scored with one of his few chances in the second half, racing forward before dragging his shot well wide. But while City may be frustrated not to have come away with a win, they will be confident of getting the job done back at the Etihad where they won 17 of 19 games there this season. Leipzig will rightly be happy with securing a draw considering the vast improvement in their attacking play in the second half, but City will feel aggrieved they did not have the chance to snatch a last-gasp winner. With seconds left, Mahrez sent the ball into the box following a short corner and as the ball was headed towards goal by Rodri, Henrichs appeared to push it away with his hands. There was no indication of a VAR check before the whistle was blown for full-time.

{"title": "Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid: Hosts thrashed by holders in Champions League last 16", "content": "3852 Liverpool have been left with a mountainous task to keep their Champions League ambitions alive after they were torn apart by ruthless Real Madrid at Anfield.  Holders Real - who beat Liverpool in last season's final in Paris - became the first side to score five at Anfield in Europe despite going two goals down early on as Liverpool made a dream start to this last-16 tie.  Darwin Nunez's brilliant flick put Liverpool ahead after only four minutes before Mohamed Salah cashed in on Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois' poor clearance to double their advantage 10 minutes later.  Liverpool's supporters, who had vented their fury at being wrongly blamed for the chaos at last season's final by holding up a flag emblazoned with \"Uefa Liars\" and loudly jeering the Champions League anthem, were soon to have their thunderous celebrations silenced in emphatic fashion.  Vinicius Junior's brilliant 21st-minute strike pulled a goal back before Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson followed Courtois' lead by hacking a clearance straight at the Brazilian, holding his head in anguish as the ball looped behind him into the net in front of a disbelieving Kop.  It changed the whole emphasis of the contest, Real going ahead two minutes after the break when Eder Militao headed in Luka Modric's free-kick.  Real then rammed home their superiority as Karim Benzema's shot deflected in off Joe Gomez, the French striker then coolly adding a fifth after more brilliant work by the ageless Modric.  Liverpool have pulled off spectacular comebacks before, but it would be truly extraordinary if they turned this one around at the Bernabeu. Liverpool made the start of their dreams as they rattled Real with their high-tempo play, getting the two goals they thought would provide the platform for a night of glory.  Instead, Anfield was reduced to near silence by the end as Jurgen Klopp's side were reduced to chasing shadows in the face of Real's imperious style and lethal threat in front of goal.  Liverpool did not help their cause with mistakes and dreadful defending, offering up invitations to a side of vast experience and world-class quality that is dangerous enough without being delivered gifts.  Alisson was guilty of an uncharacteristic error that saw Real draw level and you could visibly see the belief draining out of the side that has struck fear into opponents so many times at Anfield.  Militao's routine header from a free-kick was also helped by poor marking while the unhappy Gomez was unfortunate to deflect in Benzema's first.  The danger then was that Liverpool would concede even more as they barely raised a threat after the break. Klopp will no doubt invoke the spirit of  Barcelona in the 2019 Champions League semi-final  - when Liverpool overcame a 3-0 first-leg deficit to advance with a stunning 4-0 win at Anfield - but this is not the same Liverpool, Real are not as flimsy as the Catalans and this time the second leg is in Spain.  If Liverpool somehow pull this one off, it would be one of the most spectacular feats in their history.  Real's run to winning the Champions League last season was full of moments when they looked to be in genuine strife, first against Chelsea then especially against Manchester City in the semi-final.  And yet, under the calm guidance and wisdom the great coach Carlo Ancelotti, Real held their nerve on those occasions to win, eventually lifting the trophy against the opponents they blew away at Anfield on Tuesday.  Vinicius was the catalyst in Paris and turned the game here, firing a shot cross past Alisson before closing down the keeper for Real's second.  After that, Real were truly outstanding as they controlled possession, kept Liverpool at arm's length with ease and put away those three second-half goals that put them in complete command of this tie.  Inspired by the two great veterans Modric and Benzema, Real have an iron belief that they will prevail and so it proved again.  Many sides would have subsided after going two goals down so soon but Real simply kept playing, confident their chances would come, and they did.  Ancelotti is too experienced to allow any complacency but he will know this is a truly outstanding result for any side to achieve at Anfield, even the Champions League holders.

It follows a recent independent report that found  Uefa bears \"primary responsibility\"  for the chaotic scenes before the game against Real Madrid. Fans were penned in and sprayed with tear gas outside Paris' Stade de France as kick-off was delayed by 36 minutes. Uefa said the refund scheme \"covers all of the Liverpool FC ticket allocation for the final, i.e. 19,618 tickets\". \"We have taken into account a huge number of views expressed both publicly and privately and we believe we have devised a scheme that is comprehensive and fair,\" said Uefa general secretary Theodore Theodoridis. \"We value the input from the Liverpool FC supporter organisations Spirit of Shankly and Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association as well as the open and transparent dialogue throughout this period.  \"We recognise the negative experiences of those supporters on the day and with this scheme we will refund fans who had bought tickets and who were the most affected by the difficulties in accessing the stadium.\" Liverpool were also part of the process of securing refunds for their fans and, as supporters bought tickets from them directly rather than Uefa, the club will administer the process. Uefa and French authorities initially blamed ticketless fans for the events outside the stadium. The report, which Uefa commissioned after the 28 May final, said there was \"no evidence\" to support the \"reprehensible\" claims. It added that \"it is remarkable no one lost their life\" and the collective action of Liverpool supporters was \"probably instrumental\" in preventing \"more serious injuries and deaths\" outside the stadium. The report made 21 recommendations in an attempt to ensure \"everything possible is done\" to prevent any similar incident happening again at a major sporting event. Spirit of Shankly and the Liverpool Disabled Supporters' Association said they \"welcomed\" the \"unprecedented\" refund from Uefa. \"With a promise to reimburse supporters, Uefa have gone some way to acknowledging their part in the fiasco,\"  said a statement. \"But it does not excuse Uefa, exempt them from criticism or lessen the need for them to implement all of the recommendations made by the independent inquiry. \"We will work alongside Liverpool and publish details once we know how and when refunds will be processed.\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, whose side lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the final, said it was \"super important\" that the club's fans  had been exonerated  for the situation which occurred before the game.

The visitors had Otavio sent off in the 78th minute for two bookable offences and could not keep Inter out. The second leg takes place at Porto's Estadio do Dragao on Tuesday, 14 March. Lukaku, who has played for Chelsea, West Brom, Everton and Manchester United, came on in the 58th minute for ex-Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko and became the match-winner after he reacted quickest when his header hit the woodwork.

Teams in the three European cup competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League - have played three games a week for the majority of the last three months to ensure the group stages were finished before the start of the World Cup.

It is possible there will be no spare midweeks to play the two matches they had called off following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Privately, the Premier League feel issues over the calendar this season are solely down to world governing body Fifa, who they blame for the World Cup being played in the winter.

The Champions League last-16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland at 11:00 GMT. Teams who won their group will be drawn against teams who finished second in theirs. You cannot play a team from your own country - or your own group. The last-16 first legs will take place on 14-15 and 21-22 February, with the second legs on 7-8 and 14-15 March.   Bayern Munich, Benfica,  Napoli, Porto, Real Madrid,   AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Club Bruges, Eintracht Frankfurt, Inter Milan, Leipzig,  Paris St-Germain. Chelsea, City and Spurs will face one of AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Club Bruges, Eintracht Frankfurt, Inter Milan, Leipzig and Paris St-Germain - except the team who finished second in their group (Milan for Chelsea, Dortmund for City and Frankfurt for Spurs). Liverpool can only be drawn against Bayern Munich, Benfica, Porto or Real Madrid - since three of the eight seeded teams are English and Napoli won their group. The Reds finished second despite finishing with the third-best record in the whole group stages on 15 points. There are a couple of slightly surprising names among the seeds - with Napoli and Benfica starting in the pot. Bayern Munich, German champions for the past 10 years, and defending European champions Real Madrid - the only Spanish team in the last 16 - speak for themselves in terms of prestige. But no team will want to face Napoli, whose defeat by Liverpool in the final group game is the only time they have lost all season. They remain unbeaten and five points clear at the top of Serie A, with several of the form players in Europe including Georgian sensation Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen. Benfica, who have yet to lose a competitive game all season, snuck into the top seeds by the narrowest margin in Champions League history. An injury-time sixth goal at Maccabi Haifa took them level on points, head-to-head record, goals scored and goals conceded with Paris St-Germain. They took top spot by scoring more away goals in the group. Porto are just the second team to win a Champions League group despite losing their first two games, beating Atletico Madrid in their final game to seal top spot. Only Kylian Mbappe and Mohamed Salah (seven each) have scored more than Porto striker Mehdi Taremi's five. The English teams will hope to avoid facing Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar's Paris St-Germain. PSG, who have not lost a competitive game since March, looked set to win the group before Benfica's late flurry of goals. Not many of the other second-placed teams caught the eye, with AC Milan, Inter Milan, Eintracht Frankfurt and Leipzig all losing twice. However, Inter knocked out Barcelona and Leipzig only finished one point behind Real. The big surprise of the group stages was Club Bruges, who were in the bottom seeds when the group draw was made, but reached the knockout stage for the first time. The Belgian side did their work early, qualifying after just four games - but failed to score in their final three group matches. They are likely to be the team Manchester City, Chelsea and Spurs hope to draw. There are three other English teams still in Europe - Arsenal and Manchester United in the Europa League and West Ham in the Conference League. However, only Manchester United will be involved on Monday, with the Europa League knockout round play-off draw at 12:00 GMT. Arsenal and West Ham won their groups, putting them into the last 16 of their tournaments. But runners-up, like Manchester United, have to play a round before that.

{"title": "Pep Guardiola: Manchester City boss needs Champions League win to complete time at club", "content": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says his time at the club will 'not be complete' if they fail to win the Champions League. Guardiola  extended his contract  with City to 2025 while the Premier League season was breaking for the World Cup. City have won nine major trophies since he became coach in 2016 but they are yet to win any European silverware. They came closest to winning the Champions League in 2021, but were  beaten by Chelsea in the final .  Aside from the final defeat in Portugal, they were beaten by Real Madrid in last season's semi-final, have exited at the quarter-final stage three times and started Guardiola's tenure with a last-16 defeat by Monaco. \"It's not the only one but I admit it's the trophy we want and my period here will not be complete if we don't win it,\" said Guardiola. \"I will do everything in the time we have together but I'd say the same before. It's the trophy we don't have and we'll try to do it. I have the feeling they'll get it sooner or later.\" City have been drawn against German side RB Leipzig in the last-16 of this season's competition. This season, City are aiming to become only the fifth club to win the English title in three successive seasons and on Thursday they host Liverpool in the fourth round of the EFL Cup. Guardiola has won that trophy on four occasions, putting him level with Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho as the most successful manager in the competition's history. However, City are hampered because they had 16 players at the World Cup. Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji and Spain duo Rodri and Aymeric Laporte returned to training at the start of this week and will join Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, Erling Haaland and Riyad Mahrez as senior players available to face the Reds. \"Step by step they come back,\" said Guardiola. \"We are happy they are back. \"I have the feeling those who were at the World Cup are in better condition than players who weren't because the players who didn't go lack the rhythm.\" Guardiola praised 22-year-old striker Julian Alvarez, who was one of Argentina's standout stars during the country's  World Cup triumph in Qatar  this month.  He also commended Lionel Messi, with whom he enjoyed great success at Barcelona, and former City defender Nicolas Otamendi. \"We're delighted for Julian, he played a lot, his contribution was amazing for the team,\" said the City boss.  \"We have a world champion in our team. We are incredibly happy for him. Congratulations to him and Otamendi, and personally to Messi. To Argentina, well deserved.\" Manchester City and Liverpool's respective chief executives Ferran Soriano and Billy Hogan have written to both sets of supporters before the tie calling for calm after a series of clashes around matches between the clubs in recent seasons. At Anfield in October, City had the windscreen on their team coach smashed, while their fans sang about the tragedies that have affected Liverpool so badly. And Guardiola reiterated that message, saying he wants supporters to focus on the game. \"Be supporters and support your team unconditionally,\" he said. \"With the quality players on both sides, enjoy the game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64055053"},

{"title": "Premier League clubs dominate richest in the world - Deloitte Money League study", "content": "More than half of the world's richest clubs by revenue are from the Premier League, according to analysis by Deloitte.  Eleven Premier League clubs make up the top 20 in their Money League study from the 2021-22 season. It is the first time in the study's 26 years that more than half of the clubs are from the same league. Champions Manchester City retained top spot, making 731m euros (£619.1m), ahead of Real Madrid (713.8m euros). Liverpool rise to third from seventh, while Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal also make the top 10, with West Ham, Leicester, Leeds, Everton and Newcastle in the top 20.  The top 20 clubs made 9.2bn euros (£7.82bn), a 13% increase from 2020-21. That increase is largely down to the return of fans to stadia for the first full season after Covid-19 restrictions, with matchday revenue rising from 111m euros to 1.4bn euros.   Five of the Premier League's 'big six' - Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - reported revenue increases of 15% or more. That saw a total increase of 226m euros.   Commercial revenues rose 8%, from 3.5bn euros to 3.8bn euros (£2.975bn to £3.23bn) but there was an 11% (485m euros/£412.25m) fall in broadcast revenue. Last season's figures were higher than usual because of postponed matches from the 2019-20 season being played.  The question now is whether other leagues can close the gap [on the Premier League], likely by driving the value of future international media rights, or if the Premier League will be virtually untouchable, in revenue terms. The Premier League reported a significant increase in its international media rights value during its most recent rights sale process. La Liga, meanwhile, commenced a new domestic broadcast cycle. The league agreed deals with broadcasters for an extended five-year period, and also sold certain rights packages on a non-exclusive basis, and/or operated them directly. Commercial partner, fan and investor interest in the Premier League appears higher than ever before. While this suggests optimism for further growth, continued calls for greater distribution of the financial wealth of English clubs across the football system, and the impact of a cost-of-living crisis, makes it all the more important for the game's stakeholders to keep a clear focus on their responsibility as stewards of leading clubs. Manchester City entered the top five for the first time in 2015-16, before topping the table last season. Their impressive form on the pitch has seen them win back-to-back titles under Pep Guardiola and they posted a Premier League commercial revenue record of 373m euros (£317.05m) - a growth of 65m euros (£55.25m) on 2021-22.  Liverpool are the biggest mover, rising from seventh to third, to achieve their highest ever position and overtake Manchester United in the rankings for the first time.  Their run to the Champions League final, where they  lost 1-0 to Real Madrid , saw them gain additional broadcast revenue.  They also generated more than 100m euros (£85m) from matchday revenue for the first time, and were one of only five clubs to do so.  Arsenal became the first side to enter the top 10 since 2018-19, largely down to a rise in matchday revenue, while Leeds enter for the first time since 2002-03 and Newcastle re-enter. Both clubs have reported higher matchday and commercial revenue than many other English clubs.  If the Money League was extended to a top 30 there would be 16 Premier League clubs included, with five clubs from La Liga, three from both Serie A and the Bundesliga and one from Ligue 1. All of the teams from the other European leagues competed in Uefa club competitions in 2021-22.  Sam Boor, director in Deloitte's Sports Business Group, adds: \"The Premier League's financial superiority is unlikely to be challenged in the coming seasons.  \"This is particularly apparent at a time when these clubs continue to attract international investment which often, in the best examples, encourages a focus on profitability, as well as on-pitch success.  \"It's now likely a case of not if, but when, all 20 Premier League clubs will appear in the Money League top 30.\"  ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64314328"},
{"title": "Champions League returns: What to look out for in 2022-23 knockout stage", "content": "A clean sweep of English teams, Scott Parker managing Club Bruges, and a record number of teenage players. The Champions League knockout stages began on Tuesday as  AC Milan narrowly beat Tottenham  and  Bayern Munich continued their winning run with victory over Paris St-Germain . It's time to jog your memory on who's still in the competition - and all the reasons you should be following along.  There's plenty of English interest for you. For the fifth time in six seasons there are at least four Premier League teams in the Champions League last 16. Manchester City  and  Chelsea  won their groups,  Liverpool  advanced with a game to spare, while Tottenham put their fans through the wringer, snatching qualification from the jaws of elimination  on matchday six. England's top tier isn't the only league excelling in Europe. There are also four German teams in the knockout stages, including Bayern Munich - the only side to boast a perfect group-stage record. Italy are represented by three clubs, Portugal have two, Belgium, France and Spain have one. Speaking of Spain... La Liga may only have one side in the last 16 for the first time since the tournament was expanded in 1999-2000, but you can't do much better than the holders and record 14-time winners Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti's side take on Liverpool in a repeat of the  2018  and  2022 finals  - and Los Blancos have fond memories of both, winning 3-1 and 1-0. Liverpool's best chance of Champions League qualification might be through winning the competition. They sit nine points off the top four in the Premier League. They will have to end their rotten run against their Spanish rivals to progress, having lost six of the past seven meetings against Real. If you like final repeats, you'll love the prospect of Bayern Munich against PSG. The pair played each other in the 2020 final  with Bayern winning 1-0. .  A year later and things got even tighter with their quarter-final finishing 3-3  and the Parisians advancing on away goals  - a rule that has now been scrapped. Can World Cup winner Lionel Messi, alongside losing finalist Kylian Mbappe - if fit - pull off another statement win over the six-time champions? Maybe you're a romantic and would rather follow the history making underdog. If so, then Club Bruges could be your second team.  The Belgians advanced ahead of former finalists Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid  to reach the knockout stages  for the first time since the European Cup became the Champions League. Ex-Bournemouth and Fulham manager Scott Parker has been at the helm at Jan Breydel Stadium  since New Year's Eve  and will be in charge when they face Benfica in the last 16. As a player Parker made nine appearances in the Champions League, all with Chelsea, playing in five knockout matches in 2004  as the Blues lost to Monaco in the semi-finals. Or maybe you can get behind Eintracht Frankfurt, taking on Napoli. Their only other European Cup experience was way back in 1959-60. In the fifth season of the competition Frankfurt made it all the way to the final where they were beaten 7-3 by Real Madrid at Hamden Park.  The German side had defeated Rangers 12-4 over two legs in the last four and 62 years later they beat the Scots on penalties  in the Europa League final  to qualify for Europe's premier competition after a six-decade hiatus. Over the age of 24 and still dreaming about your Champions League debut? You might want to skip this next section. During this season's group stage, 30% of starting places were filled by players aged 23 or under and a record 89 starts were made by teenagers, according to entertainment data analysts Nielsen Gracenote. Benfica's Antonio Silva and Red Bull Salzburg's Maurits Kjaergaard, both aged 19, began all six of their team's matches. Few would look past Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham as  best teenager left in the Champions League right now.  The Stourbridge-born 19-year-old, who  was superb in midfield for England  at the World Cup, netted four goals in five games in the Champions League group stages. Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala , 19, is also carving up the Champions League, with the midfielder crafting two assists in five group games this season.  If you're good enough you're old enough and both will be hoping to make a big impact in the knockouts. Manchester City are favourites to win this season's Champions League, according to Gracenote. Their Euro Club Index simulations give City a 25% chance of lifting the trophy. Bayern Munich (17%), holders Real Madrid (14%) and Liverpool (11%) are the other main contenders - with Paris St-Germain next on 6%. Chelsea have a 5% chance, with Tottenham on just 3%. Club Bruges are the rank outsiders with... a 0% chance, according to the data experts.

{"title": "Rangers v Ajax: Dutch side aim to find form again in Champions League", "content": "Ajax's Champions League formbook since they opened Group A with a convincing 4-0 win over Rangers reads 'defeat, defeat, defeat and defeat'. Despite that dismal run, the Eredivisie leaders are in a strong position to finish third in the group and drop into the Europa League, even if they lose at Ibrox.  After all, Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side need a five-goal win to climb off bottom place. But does Ajax's form offer Rangers a faint glimmer of hope of pulling off a miraculous comeback? A game and a half into their Group A campaign, it was all going according to plan for Alfred Schreuder's side. They were tied 1-1 with a Liverpool side that opened with defeat by Napoli. Joel Matip's late goal reignited the Reds' campaign with a 2-1 win, but the Dutch side were far from embarrassed at Anfield. Embarrassment was to come, however, with Napoli leaving the Johan Cruyff Arena with a 6-1 win on matchday three and the Italians won the second contest in Naples 4-2. The return match with Liverpool was also a convincing defeat, 3-0 in the Dutch capital. Domestically, it has been a different picture for Ajax though, with comfortable wins against Heerenveen, Volendam, Excelsior and Waalwijk since they beat Rangers. Schreuder's team top the Eredivisie and have dropped five points all season, leaving them well placed to return to the Champions League next term. Schreuder  told  the Liverpool Echo he believed there to be a \"difference in level\" between his side and Liverpool following last week's 3-0 reverse. These sentiments mirror Van Bronckhorst's post-match analysis, as his Rangers side have lurched from one defeat to the next in a chastening campaign so far. But the first meeting of Ajax and Rangers indicated the Dutch side themselves were a level above their Scottish counterparts. They led 3-0 at half-time, and though Rangers had a goal ruled out by VAR, it only got worse for Van Bronckhorst's men with a late Ryan Jack mistake leading to a fourth for Ajax. The Dutch may have got Rangers at a good time, though. The Ibrox side had lost 4-0 at Celtic Park days before they travelled to Amsterdam. This time, Rangers are coming off one of their better performances of the season - the 4-1 win against Aberdeen. And, unlike other matches of late, Van Bronckhorst's side created a plethora of chances against the Dons. They will need that again on Tuesday evening - and a much-improved defence. Rangers have conceded 19 goals so far in Group A, with Scott Arfield's strike against Liverpool the only one in the 'goals for' column to date. \"I expect that every game we play,\" said Van Bronckhorst following Saturday's win. \"Our structure was really good. The crowd was with us the whole game. We started well, positive. That's the way you have to start.\" Before any Rangers fans get their hopes up of a magical night against Ajax, the history books tell an ominous story. The Dutch side have won all five of their previous meetings with Rangers, including both trips to Ibrox. Their most recent win in Govan came courtesy of Arnold Scholten's solitary goal in 1996. Ajax have also won two of their past three trips to Celtic Park. Against the current backdrop of highly funded clubs like Real Madrid, Paris St-Germain and Manchester City, the Europa League is more likely to be the most competitive arena for clubs like Ajax and Rangers, who reached last season's final.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63448503"},
{"title": "AC Milan v Tottenham: Financial gap between Premier League and Europe 'too big' - Stefano Pioli", "content": "The financial gap between the Premier League and the rest of Europe's top divisions is \"too big\", says AC Milan head coach Stefano Pioli.  Premier League clubs spent £815m during the January transfer window - nearly four times the combined £225m spent in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. Pioli's Milan host Tottenham in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday. \"I prefer to concentrate on on-field matters, but there's no match for them economically,\" the Milan coach said. The Premier League's financial dominance in Europe increased to the highest proportion ever reported in January. Spending by English top-flight clubs accounted for 79% of the total across Europe's 'big five' football leagues, where January expenditure fell by 35% from 2022. Chelsea spent more in January - around £288m - than the combined total of all clubs in La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1. Milan were one of the 12 clubs - including six from England - which agreed to join a new European Super League in April 2021. But the 19-time Italian champions were among those who pulled out after intense pressure from fans, causing what would have been a landscape-changing move to collapse. Last year, AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis - who has since left the club - said  there had to be a \"competitive balance\"  between the Premier League and other leagues. \"If they [Premier League clubs] spent 900 million euros and we in Italy didn't spend anything it's clear that there's an economic gap which is too big,\" said Pioli. Pioli, 54, led Milan to the Serie A title in the 2021-22 season - their first Scudetto since 2010-11 - but his side have struggled in their title defence.

{"title": "Champions League: The 30 years of change shaping Europe's biggest prize", "content": "It is easy to forget where the Champions League came from. Three decades ago European football's governing body Uefa sometimes didn't know what day games would be played until 48 hours before kick-off. In the first Champions League season, some of the players were still part-time. The 1992-93 inaugural edition started with two knockout rounds between September and November. Leeds and Stuttgart ended up playing a neutral venue decider for their first-round tie, in front of 90,000 empty seats at Barcelona's Nou Camp - after the German side broke Uefa's rule on only fielding three foreigners.  Eight teams progressed to make two groups of four, with games played from November to April. The group winners met in the final. Marseille - who would have their 1993 French league title stripped over match-fixing - beat AC Milan 1-0 on 26 May.  Rangers went undefeated but finished just a point behind Marseille. Second to Milan were IFK Gothenburg.  \"Before a home group game against Porto, me and a friend were at work at 7am and then played at 8.45pm,\" recalls ex-Gothenburg and Sweden midfielder Hakan Mild.  \"We were semi-professionals. We trained a lot, not less than Porto. But we didn't have the same financial situation.  \"Portuguese media were there and made a film for television. The TV people said it was unbelievable we were working and it was not possible to beat Porto, who had a good team in that period.\"  Gothenburg won that match 1-0.  There was one club per country. The champions of Scotland and Sweden were essentially semi-finalists. It sounds like a quaint, bygone age - far removed from the global phenomenon we recognise now. But it still represented a big break from what had gone before.  The European Cup had been going since 1955 but the bigger clubs weren't happy with it. The 1980s saw periodic agitation for a new - and more commercially rewarding - competition. AC Milan owner and media giant Silvio Berlusconi was one of the ringleaders.  The argument - which remains to this day and is at the crux of the controversial European Super League debate - was that because the best supported clubs drive revenues by attracting the most viewers on TV, they should get more money.  Uefa, just as it is now, was forced to navigate the tightrope of giving those clubs what they want while trying to maintain an inclusive competition. \"The clubs were always coming up with proposals that could have more matches and guarantee more money,\" says Gerhard Aigner, who served as Uefa's general secretary from 1989 to 2003.   \"We still had a knockout system and in the European Cup we had only one team from each country, so only five teams from the five big TV markets. The same in the Cup Winners' Cup. \"But in the Uefa Cup, countries had more than one team. There were more matches and more chances of clubs from the bigger markets meeting. Commercially that became a competition that had more potential than the European Cup. \"It became impossible. We realised that if Uefa didn't act and take things in our own hands, we would probably lose control of these competitions altogether.\" Its new competition, the Champions League - with its theme tune, its new broadcast package, its expanded format - was an immediate success.  \"We wanted to make it as attractive as possible for the supporters, for TV and for the clubs themselves,\" says Aigner. \"We managed to have two experts joining us who had just left ISL [Swiss marketing company International Sport and Leisure]. They had marvellous ideas and they developed great ideas about how to present a new product to the public. We also looked across the ocean at the American way of organising the Super Bowl. \"We not only could impress in terms of finances, we could also impress in terms of presentation of the competition, and probably also behaviour of the teams on the pitch.  \"The players realised they were playing on a different level. They were more conscious of the fact they were now on this platform where they have to give a certain example. I don't know whether that's still the case today, but during a certain time I had the feeling we have a better product on the field than before. \"I think even the clubs themselves and the respective national leagues were surprised how that was being done.\" Aigner felt that Uefa had pulled it off, appeasing the big clubs while maintaining sporting integrity and competitive appeal. In 1992-93, defending champions Barcelona didn't make the group stage - CSKA Moscow knocked them out. But things would evolve very dramatically, and very quickly.  Over the first two seasons of the new Champions League, the English clubs involved - Leeds and Manchester United - failed to make the group stage. In the inaugural campaign of 1992-93, Spanish and German sides were absent too. Uefa decided that to maximise income, broadcasters from the richest European countries needed to be encouraged to lodge higher bids. So changes came in for 1994-95.  The champions of eight countries - including England, Italy, Germany and Spain - went straight into a group phase expanded to make four groups of four.  As the qualifying process was stripped back, 22 national league winners - including those of Bulgaria and Norway - were excluded altogether and shoved into Uefa Cup qualifying instead. Then, in 1995, the Bosman ruling changed employment regulations for football players. As a result, Uefa's rule that clubs could only field a maximum of three foreign players (plus two who had played in that country for an uninterrupted period of five years, including three as a junior) had to be scrapped. Former Rangers midfielder Stuart McCall credits the '3+2' ruling with making his career. He was signed by the Scottish club in 1991, the same year as '3+2' was introduced. \"People talk about Sliding Doors moments,\" says Leeds-born McCall, now 58. \"In 1984 I was on the bench for England Under-21s in Turkey. I was on the touchline to come on and that would have made me English in terms of the representative game.  \"But the referee blew his whistle and I never got on. That allowed me to change my mind and become Scottish. If I had got on, I probably would not have made my way to Rangers.\" For Aigner, the Bosman ruling had a major influence on how European football has been transformed since. But he also looks back on \"mistakes made\" by Uefa. He says: \"We couldn't know about the decision that would be taken in the European Court over the Bosman case. That unbalanced the whole situation because those clubs who, until then, were able to compete with their own talents on the highest level couldn't do it any more as they started to lose their talents at a very early age.  \"Also, we didn't get the financial distribution model right in the national context because the money coming to the clubs from Europe only went to those playing European football. \"But the other mistake we made was to help the big clubs by giving four places instead of two. As long as we had two and two had to qualify, the other countries with their champions had a real chance. Now the door is too small for them to enter the competition.\" In 1997, Lennart Johansson was Uefa president and Aigner its general secretary when runners-up from the eight highest-ranked leagues, according to Uefa coefficients, were allowed into the Champions League for the first time. All eight entered at the final qualifying round and all made it to the group stage. Seven out of the eight quarter-finalists that season were from one of the 'big five' leagues - England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.  It was the start of a pattern. Every season since has seen at least six of the last eight made up by teams from those five leagues. On four occasions they've contributed the entire quarter-final line-up.  In 1999-2000 there were further changes, with four teams from the biggest three leagues allowed in, two through the qualifiers. In 2009-10, three clubs from England, Italy and Spain went straight into the group phase. In 2018-19 four teams from the biggest four leagues went straight into the group phase and the number of qualification spots went down from 10 to six.  Now 16 clubs from England, Spain, Italy and Germany account for half of the group stage. These changes have meant more games involving the richest clubs and most high-profile players.  And the biggest move is set to come.  In 2024 the Champions League will scrap the group stage as it expands again, becoming a single league of 36 teams in which each side plays 10 games against 10 different clubs, half at home and half away.  Two of the additional four spots will be allocated to teams who performed best in Uefa competition the previous season. This season, Arsenal and PSV Eindhoven would have been invited in. It is a controversial move, watered down from initial proposals that would have rewarded teams based on their previous five years' European performances, almost always favouring the biggest and most successful countries.  Plenty don't like what remains. \"It is not the same. It is an industry today,\" says 51-year-old Mild, who had four spells with Gothenburg between 1989 and 2005.  \"It was not an industry 30 years ago. It's maybe because I am getting older but it was more real in that period. It was not fake. There was more heart in it.\"  The forthcoming expansion was negotiated partly by Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli in his role as European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman. However, before it was launched Agnelli quit from the ECA, along with representatives from all 12 clubs involved in the shambolic European Super League (ESL) launch of 2021.  That idea has not gone away. A European Court of Justice ruling is due in the spring on whether Uefa should have a monopoly on organising pan-country international tournaments. If it comes down in favour of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid - the only clubs yet to formally withdraw from ESL plans - the Champions League is unlikely to be around to celebrate a 40th birthday. \"It's unfortunate,\" says Aigner, now 79.  \"The sport's authorities can't really exert [the] control that would be desirable for sporting reasons because of competition rules. \"In my time, I sent someone out to Australia to study what [Rupert] Murdoch had done to football [rugby league] out there. It almost destroyed the game by creating a rebel league.  \"But we see every day that money speaks louder. We have the World Cup in Qatar. We have the example of the [LIV] golf competition. Golfers are split in their feelings about that. \"I do understand the principle of open markets and freedom and so on. But if you look at the Premier League, most of the clubs belong to people from elsewhere. Is that what we want? Is that what the government wants?  \"What can be the interest of the owners of the clubs in the UK in European football? Can they have an interest in European football? I doubt it. \"I am afraid I am someone of an age who still has the old values, which I would like to remain.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63456291"},

What Puskas was getting at is as true now as it was when he said it all those years ago. The Madrid fans don't spare their players no matter how many trophies they may have brought to the club. Gareth Bale, deserving of the status of a Madrid great, was chased out of town. There was no love lost when many others involved in their astonishing five Champions Leagues since 2013-14 exited. Time moves on and so do the Madridismo. Quickly. This is a club that lives for the European Cup. Winning it is sometimes not even enough. It's how they win it. It's the drama. The theatre. Of their 14 triumphs the most recent one was Madrid to the core. A home loss to FC Sheriff in the group stage sparked an inquisition. The idea that this team were going to go on and win the thing was fanciful this time last year.  In their knockout game with Paris St-Germain they trailed 2-0 on aggregate with half an hour left. Karim Benzema scored a hat-trick to put them through. Against Chelsea they were 4-3 down on aggregate with 10 minutes remaining. Benzema levelled and Rodrygo won it in extra time. The Manchester City games were the piece de resistance. Trailing 5-3 with 17 minutes left, Madrid prevailed. Rodrygo scored two in a minute and Benzema secured victory five minutes later. Astonishing. The 1-0 win over Liverpool in the final was humdrum by comparison. On Wednesday they play Celtic on the back of losing to Leipzig last week and drawing with Girona on Sunday. The Celtic game has been described as must-win by the Madrid media. In the real world, it's not. In the Real world, it is. Reading the comments of players and management you get a sense that the club is about to shift gears now that the knockouts are approaching, just as they did last season. The other day, the great Andres Iniesta spoke about Carlo Ancelotti's team and 37-year-old Luka Modric in particular. \"Modric is among the best there has been and ever will be,\" he said of the Croat. In a side where the age profile is getting younger, Modric is a mainstay, the one who continues to tie it all together.  This is what's irresistible about this Madrid team, the combination of experience (Modric, Toni Kroos and Benzema) and a thrusting youth. Currently Real are being linked with Dortmund's Jude Bellingham, 19, and precocious Palmeiras winger Endrick, 16. This is the direction of travel at the Bernabeu.  If it's possible for a reigning champion to fly under the radar then that's Real this season. Much of the Champions League chat has revolved around the brilliance of Napoli and the superhuman goalscoring of Erling Haaland at Man City. City, Bayern Munich, PSG and Liverpool are all ahead of them in the betting. Ancelotti's team are like the shark in Jaws. They're circling the waters right now.  You didn't need to speak the lingo to understand the sentiment behind the front page of the Madrid daily newspaper AS on Monday. Dominated by an image of Real's brilliant young Brazilian, Vinicius Jr, the headline simply read 'Renovado'. Renewed.  The winger, and match-winner in last season's final, had committed to the club until 2027. The inside spread, a paean to the player, told you how big a deal this really is. In many ways, Vinicius is the embodiment of what Real have been doing these past few years. Instead of going with the galacticos they have shifted towards youth. Vinicius is 22 as is the outstanding midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. Rodrygo is 21. The brilliant Eduardo Camavinga is 19. In recent seasons Real have reshaped their squad and made it younger and they've done it by spending less money in a few years than the likes of Newcastle have spent since January. They spent big on Tchouameni and relatively big on Camavinga, but they've brought in about £185m selling Casemiro, Raphael Varane, Martin Odegaard, Ashraf Hakimi and Sergio Reguilon.  In 2018 Real won their 13th European Cup but the guts of that team has broken up. Keylor Navas, Varane, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo, Casemiro, Isco, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bale all played in that 3-1 win over Liverpool and have subsequently moved on. In their place - more energy, more young stars. Recently, Kroos said that the vastly improved Federico Valverde was now in the top three midfielders in the world. Valverde is only 24. The job Ancelotti has done on Valverde is quite something. The midfielder, who created the winner in the 2021 final, scored zero goals in La Liga last season and had only netted six in 148 games for the club leading into this term. In the summer, Ancelotti announced that if he couldn't get a player of Valverde's quality to score at least 10 in a campaign then he would tear up his own contract and quit management for good. Valverde is currently on seven. He'll crash through the 10 barrier soon enough. This is what faces Celtic. A game to quicken the pulse for sure. A game in one of the world's great footballing citadels against a side that's thrillingly reinventing itself. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63475348"},
{"title": "How Tottenham won Champions League group on dramatic night in Marseille", "content": "Tottenham always seem to do it the hard way.  They progressed to the knockout stage of the Champions League on Tuesday night with a  dramatic, late 2-1 victory over Marseille .  It meant they finished top of Group D, but just over half an hour earlier they were heading out of the competition into the Europa League. It is not the first time Spurs fans have endured a nerve-wracking evening in Europe, and Tuesday's frantic match in Marseille had supporters refreshing the group table on countless occasions. Supporters are used to it. During Tottenham's historic route to the 2019 final they  needed a draw in Barcelona  to finish runners-up in their group and scrape into the last 16. Former manager Mauricio Pochettino described it as \"mission impossible\" at the time. Their task in France was seemingly more straightforward - Tottenham knew a point would be enough to progress, but as events unfolded it became anything but. Spurs' position in Group D changed six times during the evening with three of the four clubs topping the group at some stage in the evening. The two teams set to qualify for the last 16 at half-time ended up being the ones knocked out of the competition by the end of the night. Frankfurt eventually finished the group stage on 10 points - the best record of any side in their first appearance in the competition in six seasons - while Tottenham's stoppage-time winner saw them top Group D. Spurs travelled to France as group leaders with Sporting Lisbon second, level on points with Frankfurt who they led on head-to-head.  Marseille, Tottenham's opponents, were bottom of the group and knew a win would send them through no matter what.  Both matches kicked off with all four teams in with a chance of progressing. Within 39 minutes, Sporting took a 1-0 lead over Frankfurt, sending them top of the group, above Tottenham who would still qualify. But then Marseille went 1-0 up on the stroke of half-time. That goal reshuffled the pack as they suddenly jumped up to second place, moving Spurs into third and heading towards the Europa League. It did not take long for Tottenham to respond in the second half, and when Clement Lenglet made it 1-1, they jumped back up to second, pushing Marseille down to third.  Frankfurt then made a move in the 62nd minute, equalising with Sporting, meaning Tottenham returned to the top of the group. The German side scored again 10 minutes later meaning they overtook Tottenham as group leaders and Sporting were bumped down to fourth. That game finished 2-1 and they had to wait to find out the outcome in France. Spurs were clinging on at 1-1 as Marseille pushed for the winner, but it was Tottenham midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg who struck in the 95th minute.  That goal meant Tottenham went through as group winners and Marseille missed out on European football altogether for the rest of the season, dropping to the bottom of the table. : Seriously the most Conte thing ever. Very lucky boys. : It's not how you start, it's how you finish. COME ON YOU SPURS! : Don't know what everyone was panicking about! Needing a result, away from home, in the last group game! Remind you of another one of our CL campaigns? Come on you Spurs! : Marseille must be gutted! They went all out to try to beat Tottenham and instead they lost the game, which means that instead of going to last 16, they don't even qualify for Europa League! : This Spurs game really is a textbook example of a game of two halves.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63479282"},
{"title": "Rangers 1-3 Ajax: Ibrox side finish pointless and set new worst goal difference record", "content": "A harrowing first Champions League campaign in 12 years for Rangers came to a close with the ignominy of a new pointless record for the group phase. Rangers needed an improbable five-goal swing to beat Ajax to third place and the Europa League. What they got was another painful reminder of the ruthless quality in this tournament. Goals from Steven Berghuis, Mohammed Kudus and Francisco Conceicao made it six straight defeats for the Ibrox men, as a James Tavernier penalty left them with a goal difference of minus 20. Rangers are the first Scottish team to go through the group phase without a point and become the 22nd side in the history of the competition to do so. Dinamo Zagreb had previously held the unwanted worst record with a minus 19 goal difference from season 2011-12 - a tally matched by Viktoria Plzen this term but eclipsed by the Scottish Premiership side. Injuries have hampered Rangers but the gulf between the Glasgow team and their Group A opponents has been stark. The air was still thick with smoke from Ajax fans' pre-match pyrotechnics when the visitors struck. A slick move opened up the Rangers defence, with Kudus providing a neat lay-off for Berghuis to side-foot beyond Allan McGregor. The home side responded in determined style, with former Ibrox favourite Calvin Bassey denying his old team-mate Fashion Sakala with a goal-line clearance. However, further defensive frailties were exposed with Kudus given far too much time inside the penalty area and his shot going in via a big deflection off Leon King. Now Ajax were brimming with confidence and it took a good diving save from McGregor to deny Steven Bergwijn before the same player drilled an angled shot narrowly wide.  That passage of play prompted loud boos from home fans fed up with a perceived lack of application from their side and there was another scare just before half-time as Kudus was close to turning in a mis-hit strike from Berghuis. Supporters had to be content with cheering the odd hard tackle in a largely dreary second half as the hosts battled for a way back and Ajax dropped their tempo. The impressive Kudus was denied a second goal after a VAR check for offside, while Scott Arfield's dipping volley had to be tipped over by Remko Pasveer. Alfredo Morelos then somehow skewed his shot wide of an open goal before Rabbi Matondo was bundled over for a 87th-minute penalty, which Tavernier slotted down the middle for just Rangers' second goal in these six outings. That looked like staving off the dreaded record until Conceicao was allowed to jink forward and drill in a third for Ajax. With four experienced central defenders missing, Rangers paired teenager Leon King with United States midfielder James Sands at the back and they could do little to stem the flow of Ajax attacks in a one-sided first half. Steven Davis and Scott Arfield, with a combined age of 71, were overrun in midfield as the Dutch reminded us of the matchday one mauling in Amsterdam. Home heads dropped after the second goal much to the ire of the Ibrox support and, while it must be acknowledged this has been a devilishly difficult group, there has been none of the aggression or intensity that took Rangers all the way to the Europa League final last season. Manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst will be glad this Champions League nightmare is over and must now quickly lift his side again for the remaining Premiership matches before the World Cup break since they cannot afford to lose any more ground in the title race. \"After playing six games you can see the difference in level - that's why it's very difficult for us to get results. \"You know the gap is there, but we don't want to concede so many goals. We struggled against teams of the highest quality, it's a big learning experience for us. It's been hard, those are facts.\" Rangers go to St Johnstone for the Scottish Premiership lunchtime kick-off on Sunday (12:00 GMT).

{"title": "Marseille 1-2 Tottenham: Spurs win Champions League group after last-gasp goal sinks Marseille", "content": "1143 Tottenham went through to the Champions League last 16 as Group D winners after scoring in stoppage time to beat Marseille on a dramatic, frantic evening in France. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg struck in the 95th minute to secure Tottenham's progress to the last 16 on a night when they were once heading out of the competition. Spurs needed a draw to qualify for the knockout stage but Marseille took the lead through defender Chancel Mbemba on the stroke of half-time. That meant Spurs dropped to third in the group - heading into the Europa League - before Clement Lenglet equalised early in the second half. Tottenham were holding on desperately late on, but as Marseille pushed for the winner they needed to go through, they were caught on the break and Hojbjerg sealed victory for Spurs. It was a dramatic evening as results throughout Group D had a bearing on Tottenham's progress in the competition and made for anxious viewing. Sporting Lisbon's 2-1 home defeat by Frankfurt meant Spurs ultimately finished top, but at one point they dropped to third in the group - heading out of the competition - and their position changed six times during the match, with three different teams topping the table during the evening.  The stoppage-time winner by Hojbjerg also saw Marseille finish bottom of the group, meaning they missed out on a place in the Europa League as well as failing to progress to the knockout stage of the Champions League. Tottenham were under pressure for large spells - former Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez and Jordan Veretout were both denied for Marseille before Spurs improved in the second half.  Harry Kane was inches from getting on the end of a cross to make it 1-1 just after half-time, before Lenglet capitalised on Spurs' improvement with a clever header from Ivan Perisic's free-kick. Tottenham striker Kane later had a goal disallowed when he was clearly offside, before Hojbjerg fired the ball against the crossbar. The drama continued as Marseille had a glorious chance to make it 2-1 with less than 10 minutes remaining when Sanchez's shot was crucially blocked by Perisic from close range before ex-Arsenal defender Sead Kolasinac headed wide while unmarked. But Tottenham managed to cling on and Kane held the ball up in the dying seconds before sliding it through for Hojbjerg to find the back of the net and silence a wild crowd in Marseille. Tottenham were up against it from the first minute as they arrived at a hostile Stade Velodrome - which was not full as  punishment for recent crowd trouble  but nonetheless vociferous.  Fireworks were set off in streets around the stadium before and during the match, while Marseille supporters gathered in clouds of smoke from flares to welcome their team before kick-off. Spurs were also without manager Antonio Conte as he  served a touchline ban  following the draw with Sporting Lisbon, but they knew a point would see them advance to the knockout stage. Tottenham assistant Cristian Stellini, who stood in for Conte, told BT Sport: \"I enjoyed it when we won.  \"I spoke with Antonio. He's tired because to watch from the crowd is not normal. He wasted a lot of energy.  \"It's better to stay on the touchline because you live the game like the players are doing.\" Spurs had never beaten a French team away from home in Europe and were on the back foot in the first half with Hugo Lloris the busier goalkeeper. Both teams were dealt injury blows before the break too, as on-loan Manchester United centre-back Eric Bailly was forced off for Marseille before Tottenham's Son Heung-min suffered a heavy blow to the head. Son was struggling as he was helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a four-minute stop in play for treatment. He was replaced by Yves Bissouma a minute later with Spurs playing with 10 men momentarily.  Earlier on Tuesday, the Professional Footballers' Association  renewed calls  for temporary concussion substitutions, saying the current protocols are \"jeopardising player safety\". The second half was much improved from Spurs but at times they were cagey to defend their point and it almost allowed Marseille to cause an upset. Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris told BT Sport afterwards: \"It was a tough night, a great battle and even more [of a psychological battle].  \"We could feel in the first half a team was playing without the fear to lose - it was Marseille - and in the second half we had a team that was fearing to lose - and it was us. \"When we had to face difficulties, we showed great personality and it's a great result.\" The hosts had several big chances late on with Perisic's block and Kolasinac's miss huge moments in the game. In the end Marseille's push to find a winner cost them European football for the rest of the season, while Spurs sneak through with three wins from their six group matches.

{"title": "Liverpool 2-0 Napoli: Jurgen Klopp's side finish second in group despite win at Anfield", "content": "1891 Liverpool ended Napoli's flawless Champions League record with victory at Anfield but still had to settle for second place in Group A.  Jurgen Klopp's side were looking to bounce back from Saturday's home defeat by Leeds United and their spirits will be lifted by late goals from Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez which ended the impressive Serie A leaders' unbeaten 21-game run.  Liverpool never looked remotely like securing the four-goal winning margin they would have needed against Napoli - who have exerted complete domination over the group - to finish top, but these three points will act as a real boost to morale.  Thiago Alcantara brought a save from Napoli keeper Alex Meret in the first half, while Napoli thought they had broken the deadlock after the break only for defender Leo Ostigard's header from a free-kick to be ruled out for offside after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) examination.  A game of few chances looked to be heading for a draw but Liverpool snatched the win when Mohamed Salah forced home a close-range finish with five minutes to go, with Nunez sealing the deal in added time. \"I would have really enjoyed the game even without the goals,\" Klopp told BT Sport. \"We showed tonight a reaction. Being compact makes all the difference. We have challenges in the right placed and are difficult to play against. You see what Napoli are able to do in the moment.  \"It was a really good game for us. A lot of courage and bravery, going into challenges and making a fight of it. Two set-pieces bring us the points and 15 points in a Champions League group is insane.\" The vulnerability of Liverpool's defence, not helped by a struggling midfield, has been one of the features of their disappointing start to the season but Ibrahima Konate showed what they have been missing as they confirmed a slot in the last 16 of the Champions League. Konate suffered a pre-season knee injury that forced him to miss the start of the campaign, then he was sidelined again by a further muscle problem that saw Liverpool's rearguard struggle badly without him. The 23-year-old France defender returned against the formidable Napoli attack and gave an outstanding display as Liverpool looked a far more secure proposition than they have in recent times. Konate's defensive quality alongside Virgil van Dijk kept the dangerous Victor Osimhen at bay, showing composure, pace and physical presence as Napoli suffered the rare taste of defeat. True, Napoli were not at their most destructive and knew it would take something truly special from Liverpool to turn this group on its head, but the class demonstrated by Konate illustrated exactly why manager Jurgen Klopp will hope this talented young defender can now have an injury-free run for the rest of the season. Liverpool's form and approach have been questioned after defeats by struggling Nottingham Forest and Leeds United - criticism justified given just how poor they were, looking a shadow of the team that spent nearly all of last season in pursuit of a historic quadruple. Klopp's team will take great heart from beating Napoli, although context must be given in that the Italians knew only a four-goal margin of defeat would make any difference to the group standings. It removed a large element of jeopardy from the group, Liverpool's goals coming so late that there was never any opportunity for Anfield to be whipped up into any sort of frenzy of expectation. This, however, was an example of what Liverpool can do but also showed the two faces of their season so far. They have beaten Manchester City and Napoli at Anfield without conceding a goal but also suffered those damaging losses to teams who have spent the early part of this term in struggle, as well as losing at Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams they have punished heavily in recent seasons. Liverpool looked more secure at the back, survived a VAR scare when Odigard thought he had scored, then ended the match on a high with those two late scrambled goals that will act as a real mood changer for manager Klopp, his players and the club's followers who have been so disappointed by their form so far this season. The key now is consistency and Liverpool face a serious test of their credentials when they travel to Tottenham, who savoured  victory in Marseille  that saw them win their group, for a Premier League tie on Sunday.

{"title": "Real Madrid 5-1 Celtic: 'Hungry European champions teach Scots savage lesson'", "content": "No wonder Real Madrid fans expressed an excitement bordering on ecstasy when the news came through this week that Vinicius Junior had signed a new deal that will keep him at the Bernabeu for another five years at a cool £8.6m a year.  The outpouring of joy was untrammelled - and no wonder. He might hail from Rio de Janeiro state, on Guanabara Bay, but he's a Madrid boy now.  Age 22, he's left his impoverished upbringing behind. He plays with a relentless joy that disguises some of the racism that is directed at him in Spain. He rises above it and lights up most grounds he plays in. This one most of all.  Having missed a sitter in the first half against Celtic, Vinicius Junior eventually scored later on, planting Federico Valverde's cross past Joe Hart. It was Real's fourth, a just reward for all the work he'd put in. Not a lot went his way for much of the night, but he was an unending menace all the same, a player who must be a living nightmare to defend against. He has company in that, of course. Luka Modric was effortlessly excellent. Toni Kroos was a rock. Valverde, the 24-year-old Uruguayan, gave further ballast to the recent claim by Modric that the he is \"top three in the world\".  One of the great wonders of this Champions League is that the bookmakers made Real fifth in the betting to retain their title. Or did. It's a lunacy.  True, they built their lead with two penalties in the first 21 minutes, both of them correct decisions but also unfortunate. No Real player was scythed down in their creation. One was a handball by Moritz Jenz, the other an elbow-ball by Matt O'Riley. Whatever physical and psychological work Ange Postecoglou would have done in the build-up was immediately compromised, all the more so when Josip Juranovic missed from the spot himself when it was still 2-0.  Looking down from the Gods at the Bernabeu, Thibaut Courtois suddenly looked like the size of a house, a towering presence in goal. He's 6ft 7in. He looked eight foot. Juranovic's main hope was to send him the wrong way. He didn't. Once Courtois read his intentions, the Croat was in all sorts of trouble.  Add that one to the pile of missed opportunities in this campaign. The final score was emphatic but, once again, Celtic contributed something to the contest.  Wastefulness didn't cost them a result - Real could and probably should have scored a few more - but it certainly added to their frustration. Jota's superb late free-kick gave them a crumb. The Portuguese should really have played from the start, not that it would have much difference to the bottom line. In a stadium that's a construction site, on a pitch still showing the scorch marks of the extreme heat of August, Celtic's Champions League story ended as it started. There was no plot-twist at the finish, no dramatic flourish to round it all off.  It was another tale of decent chances missed and severe punishment exacted. In a footballing paradise, they lost again.  When they conclude the revamp work at the Bernabeu, it's going to be so space-age they might think about launching rockets from the halfway line. There's going to a retractable roof and a mechanism that allows the pitch to be stored underground.  The ground will literally be able to open up and swallow the opposition. How many visiting teams in the past wished that option was available to them. There will be many more in the future. In the here and now, it was Celtic's turn to suffer.  In one sense, this is the same sport they play in Scotland, but in many other ways it's alien territory. They're rarely punished for any profligacy in the Premiership. But in the Champions League? In Madrid? Against the champions angered by a loss last week to RB Leipzig and a draw on Sunday against Girona? Forget it.  This Real team looks hungry. An audit of the winners medals of their starting XI shows more silverware than any club on earth. One World Cup, two English Premier Leagues, 13 Bundesligas, 20 World Club Cups, 24 La Ligas and 26 Champions Leagues - and that's not counting domestic cups, Europa Leagues and other baubles. They are a winning machine.  Valverde doesn't necessarily spring to mind when talking about the finest footballers in Europe, but he unquestionably is. His shot brought about the first penalty, he was involved in the build-up to the third goal, scored the fourth and assisted on the fifth. Since swinging in the cross that Vinicius tucked away to win the Champions League last season, Valverde has been a sensation. This was a player who failed to score in La Liga last season and who had only found the net six times in 148 games before the start of this season.  In the summer, Carlo Ancelotti made a fair old statement when he said that if he couldn't get a player of Valverde's excellence to score at least 10 goals a season then he was giving up management. Valverde is now on eight. The Real coach can rest easy. He'll still be in work for a while yet.  Trying to live with this was too much for Celtic. Even if they suddenly morphed into a ruthless goalscoring machine, the chances are that Real would still have found extra gears to motor away from them. That's what this team, in their stadium that will cost close to a billion euros when completed, are capable of.  Celtic did okay on the night and still conceded five. That's how savagely tough the Champions League is. They'll retreat to Scotland where they will be kings again, lording it over most - if not all - sides they face. The big task for them now is to get back on this stage next time.  Postecoglou said Celtic have to be in this competition in order to progress. That's a tough school, but they'll be desperate to get back in the classroom. There's much to learn at the feet of the masters. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63493731"},
{"title": "Real Madrid 5-1 Celtic: Scottish champions routed in final group game", "content": "Celtic ended a frustrating Champions League campaign in grim fashion as Real Madrid handed out a rough lesson to claim victory and top Group F. The Scottish champions were 2-0 down after 21 minutes as Luka Modric and Rodrygo converted penalties awarded for handball in a brutal opening. Josip Juranovic then missed a spot-kick for Celtic, and that seemed a distant memory when Marco Asensio, Vinicius Junior, and Federico Valverde made it a rout for the defending champions, even though Jota netted a late free-kick. Carlo Ancelotti's side turned on the style in the second half against an increasingly tired and open Celtic, who finish bottom of the section with two points and no wins in their six matches. Real, though, march on in their quest for a 15th European title having earned the win that guarantees top spot in the group. With two points from five matches, Celtic knew not even a famous win would extend their stay in Europe, but their fans still travelled in hope, with far more than the official 1,848 allocation seemingly inside the Bernabeu.  The wind was taken out their sails with just four minutes on the clock. In attempting to block Valverde's tame shot, Moritz Jenz got himself in an awful twist and handled the ball. Modric showed his customary coolness to slot home. The visitors responded well, fashioning decent openings for Kyogo Furuhashi and Reo Hatate, but neither could trouble Thibaut Courtois in the Real goal. In fact, the trouble was about to deepen for Celtic. Rodrygo's strike struck the arm of Matt O'Riley and, although not quite as clearly as the Jenz incident, the outcome was the same. This time Rodrygo converted the penalty. Vinicius missed an absolute sitter just a minute later as Real threatened to run away with it in the opening half-hour. Celtic had to get up the pitch and did so to great effect as Hatate robbed the ball to allow Daizan Maeda to put Kyogo through. However Courtois stood tall and was also equal to Hatate's piledriver from the edge of the box moments later. Then a huge chance for Celtic. Liel Abada's surge to the bye-line was checked by a foul by Ferland Mendy. It was a third penalty in a crazy first half, but Courtois foiled the Scottish champions again, diving to his right to push away Juranovic's spot-kick.  Six minutes after the break, Real put the game beyond whatever little doubt still existed with their third goal. Dani Carvajal ghosted to the bye-line and his sliding cross teed-up Asensio to fire past Joe Hart. Vinicius added another after stealing ahead of Carl Starfelt to flash in a teasing Valverde cross before Real summoned Ballon D'or winner Karim Benzema from the bench on his return from injury. The Madridistas were enjoying themselves and Valverde added to that - and piled further pain on the visitors - when he curled a gorgeous effort beyond Hart and into the net. The Celtic fans could be forgiven for begging for the final whistle, but Jota gave them something to cheer when he curled a wonderful free-kick past Courtois. It was a lovely moment for the Portuguese winger and gave the visiting supporters something to cheer, but it was no more than a consolation on a night when the gulf between the champions of Scotland and the champions of Europe was laid bare. The question heading into this Champions League campaign was whether Celtic's relentless attacking style would hold up against Europe's finest. Two points from a possible 18, four goals scored, and 15 conceded in six group games would suggest not.  It is not a lot to show from a group many fans thought they may have had a decent chance of emerging from.  But Celtic have have been competitive for spells of every match and, had they taken a few more of the many chances they created, some of those games may well have had a more positive outcome. Ifs, buts and maybes. Celtic's three opponents would point out they also had numerous chances over and above the ones they took, as was the case again in Madrid. Ange Postecoglou will be heartened that many of his players have not looked out of place in the club's first group-stage appearance in five years, but this team is still short of the quality they need turn opportunities spurned into points.  \"We wanted to play a good game after our last Champions League game was not so good - we did well. \"Celtic had an opportunity to come back into the game with a penalty but I think we were really focused to play well and win.\"  \"I'm disappointed for the players and our supporters that they didn't get more joy out of the game, but I can't fault the players' efforts - I thought they gave it everything. \"We came here and created opportunities that I think other clubs would struggle to. There's something in that for us, but ultimately we fell short.\" With their European campaign over for this season, Celtic host Dundee United on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

The hosts had already wrapped up top spot with a game to spare but were looking to respond after they were stunned 4-1 in the Premier League by Brighton on Saturday. They made the worst possible start as they fell behind in the sixth minute when the Blues defence reacted poorly to a cross and Bruno Petkovic was able to head in from close range. Chelsea initially struggled to create much in response but a well-worked move brought them their equaliser as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang backheeled the ball to Raheem Sterling inside the box and he kept his cool to slot in. On-loan Juventus midfielder Zakaria then marked a dream debut as he drove in a low shot midway through the first half that squeezed over the line despite a defender's attempt to clear. Dinamo needed to win to finish third and go into the Europa League and Edouard Mendy made a good save to deny Bosko Sutalo's point-blank header early in the second half. Aubameyang came close to adding a third for Chelsea when he powered a shot against the crossbar and Conor Gallagher was denied late on, but ultimately Zakaria's goal was enough to seal the win for the Blues. With the World Cup in Qatar around the corner, this is a nervous time for many players hoping to feature at the tournament as they look to avoid any late injuries. This came close to being the perfect night for Chelsea but there was late concern as, deep in stoppage time, full-back Ben Chilwell fell to the floor after clutching his hamstring. Chilwell looked understandably frustrated once he was able to get to his feet, but he continued to hold the back of his leg before needing assistance from Chelsea's medical staff to get off the pitch. England's World Cup opener is against Iran on 21 November and Chelsea and England will both be hopeful the issue is ultimately not as serious as it looked. There was more positive news for Chelsea in the performance of Zakaria, who has had a strange start to his career at Stamford Bridge. The defensive midfielder was signed on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day from Juventus by previous boss Thomas Tuchel, but he was overlooked for game time by the German and then his replacement Graham Potter. However, the Switzerland international was a surprise inclusion in the starting line-up on Wednesday and he made the most of his chance. On top of his goal, Zakaria was clearly determined to impress. He produced a busy performance and in the second half he made an excellent tackle to halt a Dinamo attack and immediately send Aubameyang away. His display should ensure he will not have to endure another long wait to pull on a Chelsea shirt again.

A Champions League fixture such as this one carries its own importance - not least given Shakhtar remain in the mix for a place in the last 16 - but these chances to represent their homeland means so much more to those travelling to Glasgow. \"Every big sporting event helps to take people's mind off things, even for just a little while,\" Stepanenko tells the BBC. \"Sometimes you can distract your brain from the situation, watch football and support your team.\"  The midfielder was in Ukraine when the Russian invasion started in February and can remember it vividly.  \"I got up at five in the morning and saw the first explosions on a factory or something like that,\" he says.  \"I thought something had happened as my house was near a military base. I thought it was military preparations. But then we started to read the news and check our phones. We realised the war had started.\"  Stepanenko was among a number of players who were able to leave the country, managing to flee with his young children, carrying just a suitcase.  Following their escape, Shakhtar played a number of charity matches in Europe before returning to Ukraine for the start of the country's Premier League season.  In September, they drew with Celtic in Warsaw - their Champions League matches being played in Poland due to safety concerns. Over the past few weeks, attacks on Kyiv and Lviv - where the team have been based of late - have increased.  Without a permanent home, the players can spend up to 11 hours getting to and from matches, but some respite came when Shakhtar were allowed to call off their domestic game to prepare for the trip to Scotland.  \"We move from city to city and country to country. I can't say I stay in one place,\" Stepanenko says. \"It's quite difficult because usually you don't have time to recover.\"  Many of the players in the squad have risen through the ranks of Shakhtar's academy after most of the club's foreign players left at the start of the invasion, with a contingent of 15 dropping to three. \"The academy players feel the spirit of the club, they feel the commitment of being citizens of Ukraine and they are like one collective,\" Stepanenko says. \"We're like a big family.\"  It's hoped that the Champions League will also help bring attention back to the ever-changing situation in Ukraine.  \"We try to play football for our country. We have to win,\" he says. \"It's important that everyone knows what is happening in Ukraine and support the country. It's a very important message.\" Beyond Tuesday's Champions League match, what are Stepanenko's hopes for the future? \"What do I dream about?\" he says. \"Peace in Ukraine.

{"title": "Celtic, Rangers and Hearts' tasks to stay in Europe", "content": "A glance at the European tables containing Celtic, Rangers and Hearts makes for grim reading - but there is a glimmer of hope for all three as they try to secure continental football after Christmas. It has been a chastening two months for Scotland's European representatives, with Hearts' win against RFS of Latvia the only victory from 12 games played. There is no prospect of Champions League involvement, but what do the trio have to do to get into the Europa League and stay in the Europa Conference League? Celtic host Shakhtar Donetsk on October 25 then travel to reigning European champions Real Madrid the following Wednesday. Ange Postecoglou's side have one point - earned in the draw against Shakhtar - and simply have to beat the Ukrainian side at Celtic Park to have any chance of progressing. That would take them to within a point of third-place Shakhtar and mean a draw in the Bernabeu - bear with us - would take them into the Europa League play-offs if the Ukrainians lost to RB Leipzig.  All sounds disconcertingly unlikely doesn't it? If you're still with us, here's the tiniest morsel of hope: Real may well have qualified as group winners by beating Leipzig in matchday five so could field a relatively weakened side against Celtic.  Real beating Leipzig would also mean the German side could still be caught by Shakhtar, so they will be committed to victory in their final game. Celtic and Shakhtar would both finish on five points but the Scottish side would progress by virtue of a better head-to-head record thanks to the win in Glasgow.  Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side have lost all four matches so far and that opening-game thrashing against Ajax is still haunting them. As a result of that 4-0 defeat, they almost certainly have to avoid defeat at Napoli, one of Europe's in-form teams, on October 26 to have a chance. That's because while Ajax might lose to Liverpool - and leave Rangers within three points with their meeting in Glasgow to come on November 2 - the Dutch side's handsome victory at the Amsterdam Arena in September means Van Bronckhorst's team would have to win 5-0 at Ibrox. They certainly have to at least match Ajax's result against Liverpool when they play Napoli. The tiny glimmer? Jurgen Klopp's side need at least a point to make sure of second - they might even fancy their chances of topping the group. There are now additional knockout round play-offs - prior to the round of 16 - between the eight Europa League group runners-up and the eight third-ranked teams from the Champions League groups.  The draw for that takes place on November 7 and the Europa League knockout stage begins on 16 February, with the final on 31 May. Hearts complete group A in the Europa Conference League by hosting RFS on 27 October and travel to Turkey to play Istanbul Basaksehir a week later. They need to win both their games to get to nine points, and hope Fiorentina - who currently sit on seven - only manage one draw against either RFS and Istanbul Basaksehir. Hearts could finish on the same number of points as the Italian side if they draw both their remaining games but La Viola's head-to-head record is superior after victories home and away against Robbie Neilson's men. The tiny glimmer of hope? Fiorentina have taken only one point from the reverse fixtures. There is a knockout round of play-offs - prior to the round of 16 - between the eight Europa Conference League group runners-up and the eight third-ranked teams from the Europa League groups.

{"title": "Manchester City 3-1 Sevilla: Rico Lewis, Julian Alvarez & Riyad Mahrez cancel out Rafa Mir opener", "content": "0 Seventeen-year-old Rico Lewis scored on his full Manchester City debut as the Blues came from behind to beat Sevilla in their final Champions League group game. City were trailing to a first-half header from former Wolves and Nottingham Forest striker Rafa Mir when Lewis strode on to Julian Alvarez's pass seven minutes after the break and drove a powerful shot past Yassine Bounou. It was a moment Lewis will remember for the rest of his life and the joy on his face as he celebrated was something to behold. But if the young full-back needed a reminder of the sustained quality required to make it at City, he got it through a superb curling pass from substitute Kevin de Bruyne for the Blues' second, which went around the back of the Sevilla defence and sent Alvarez running clear. Riyad Mahrez wrapped up the scoring seven minutes from time. City are now unbeaten in 23 Champions League games at the Etihad Stadium and, with prolific front-man Erling Haaland watching from the stands and Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips to return from injury, no-one will relish facing them when the competition resumes in February. Pep Guardiola has been rotating the same group of experienced players plus a handful of youngsters all season and, despite the packed schedule and his side's status as group winners already assured, the City boss did not change that philosophy. There was the first start for Lewis though. Born in nearby Bury, Lewis has been with City since he was eight, so this would have been a proud night for his family even without the added ingredient of a goal. Guardiola simply doesn't just hand first-team spots away, so Lewis would have known he'd earned it. And when his manager was yelling at him early in the game to get wider and make himself available for a pass, it was clear Guardiola would not be going easy on him either. But Lewis was happy to adopt the Joao Cancelo tactic of moving into midfield from his full-back berth when City pushed forward - and the long-range shot he screwed wide before the opening period drew to a close suggested no lack of confidence. His exchange of expressions when Phil Foden caught up with him after his goal was wonderful. Lewis' first City goal had come at a younger age than Foden's - he had to wait until he was 18. Lewis was only 13 when City last lost a European home game which is a startling statistic. The sustained ovation he received as he walked around the pitch to the bench after being told to leave it near the halfway line on the far side when he was replaced by Cancelo five minutes from time was the stuff dreams are made of. Sevilla have been a shadow of their former selves this season. Julen Lopetegui has already been sacked, thus allowing Wolves to make their move for him and his replacement Jorge Sampaoli has only managed two wins in seven games as his side dropped into the La Liga relegation zone. Yet, both in their starting line-up and on the bench, they have players of quality.  At 34, Ivan Rakitic retains the smoothness on the ball that helped Croatia reach the World Cup final four years ago and Thomas Delaney was excellent in his Borussia Dortmund days. Mir failed to score in 17 combined appearances for Wolves and Nottingham Forest and has not found the net for Sevilla since August. Given the manner in which he guided his far-post header across goal and sent it curling into the far corner for his first-half opener, he should have done. It proved to be another false dawn for the Spanish side, who drop into the Europa League, a competition they have won a record six times, most recently in 2020, when they accounted for Wolves and Manchester United in the knockout phase.

{"title": "Tottenham v Sporting Lisbon: Marcus Edwards aims to upset former club", "content": "It is a harsh path unfortunately trodden by many young footballers. Marcus Edwards was likened to Lionel Messi aged 17, but just three years later he was let go by Tottenham - the club he had been on the books of since he was eight years old. But the attacking midfielder, now 23, used that disappointment to his advantage and is now shining for Spurs' Champions League opponents on Wednesday - Sporting Lisbon. Edwards showed what his boyhood club has missed out on with a  superb display against them in Portugal last month , and will be determined to do it again when he returns to north London. Edwards will once again face his former side with a point to prove, but why was someone compared to one of the greats of the game unable to push through at the club he spent practically his entire childhood at? It was then Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino who made the comparison to Messi, saying in 2016: \"The qualities, his body and the way that he plays it is reminiscent a little bit from the beginning of Messi.\" A left-sided midfielder, Edwards - like Messi - has a low centre of gravity and quick feet - so the comparisons were understandably obvious, but at the same time it put a lot of expectation and pressure on the youngster, especially for someone who was already being carefully managed. Edwards was shy as a teenager and would largely keep himself to himself. According to Pochettino's 2017 autobiography, he also had behavioural and timekeeping issues. The latter two characteristics made it difficult for coaches to feel he could be rewarded by being given the platform for his undoubted talent to shine until they were resolved.  Attempts to do that were made with loan spells away from the club, firstly with then Championship side Norwich, but he was sent back to Spurs after just one appearance for the Canaries, with timekeeping and general attitude  reportedly the reasons  behind his stay being cut short. Another failed loan spell at Dutch side Excelsior followed before Edwards left Tottenham having made just one appearance for the club - in a League Cup match against Gillingham in 2016. \"That path to the top is different for every person,\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast. \"The head of the academy at the time at Spurs, John McDermott, did a lot of work with Marcus. \"You don't know if what you choose to do is going to be the right thing, but that's why they did what they did, they chose to hold him back realising 'no, you need a better personality to deal with the things that are going to come with you'.\" Failing to break through at Spurs, Edwards' 13-year association with the club came to an end in September 2019. He left not just his home club but country too, as he moved to Portugal to join Vitoria Guimaraes. Portuguese football journalist Tom Kundert felt it was a brave move, particularly for someone seen as rather introverted. \"I have been living here in Portugal for 25 years and I am always quite excited when an English person comes over here to play,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I can probably count them on one hand, so it was a brave move by him.\" It did not take him long to make an impression. Just a few weeks after joining the club Edwards scored his first goal, eight minutes into a  Europa League tie with Spurs' rivals Arsenal . Nineteen more goals followed as Edwards made 96 appearances for Vitoria before Sporting Lisbon made a move in January. Edwards has put in a number of eye-catching displays for Sporting, notably in the  2-0 victory against Spurs  last month in the Champions League fixture in Portugal. His stand-out moment came just before half-time when he received the ball, took on several Tottenham players and played a one-two before his shot was saved by Hugo Lloris. \"Francisco Trincao was seen as the marquee signing for Sporting, the player most fans were looking to be the main man, but it has been Edwards,\" Kundert added. \"He has been man of the match in a fair quantity of matches. \"He is playing much more centrally than he certainly has done while he has been in Portugal and it appears to be bringing the best out of him. \"He has such an incredible dribbling ability and close control. He is a really exciting player to watch.\" That moment against Spurs, and Edwards' performance as a whole, prompted many observers to suggest he should receive a senior England call-up. Edwards is also eligible for Cyprus through his mother, but played for England up to under-20s level and helped them  win the European Under-19 Championship  five years ago. Sporting coach Ruben Amorim believes his forward is ready to make his senior debut for England. \"He has the characteristics, he has the talent,\" he said. \"He can make it into the England national team.\" This year's World Cup may just come too soon for Edwards, but another headline-grabbing display against Spurs on Wednesday night and he will become increasingly hard for Gareth Southgate to ignore.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63136904"},

In a breathless game in Austria, Chelsea produced one of their best performances under Potter. A commanding first-half display saw them take the lead when Austria-born midfielder Kovacic rifled in an unstoppable left-foot finish from 18 yards. \"It's nice to score in the country where I was born. My parents were here and so were my friends,\" Kovacic, who was later withdrawn with a calf issue, told BT Sport.

City have failed to score 25 of their 80 penalties, excluding shootouts, since the Catalan took over in 2016. Mahrez was fouled by Emre Can and stepped up himself, but Gregor Kobel went the right way to save his kick. Borussia Dortmund also went through to the last 16 with the draw, so both sides will be happy with the result. \"Since I've been here we've missed 25 penalties, most of them in the Champions League,\" Guardiola said.  \"It's too many. You always have to admire the courage, but missing so many penalties is a problem.  \"We have to improve. It comes down to fine margins in this competition and these situations can make the difference.\" City's Champions League penalty scoring record (71%, 12/17) is actually slightly better than their Premier League record (69%, 36/52). Former Scotland forward James McFadden, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, said: \"I think it was a very good penalty from Mahrez. It's a side foot with a lot of power, what a save.\"  Mahrez has now missed three of his past four penalties for City, after scoring nine of his first 10. City boss Guardiola surprisingly replaced top scorer Erling Haaland at half-time after just 13 touches. He revealed afterwards that the  Norwegian had a fever and a knock. Dortmund had good chances too, with 17-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko slotting wide and debutant City keeper Stefan Ortega making several saves. City will be happy to have won their Champions League group with a game to spare, but it is just one win in their past four games in all competitions now. Last time out in Europe they drew 0-0 in Copenhagen, and then lost their unbeaten record to Liverpool in the league - before beating Brighton on Saturday. Guardiola mixed things up with his line-up in Dortmund, giving a debut to 29-year-old keeper Ortega, a summer signing, with Ederson left on the bench. The German did well to deny Karim Adeyemi and Moukoko in the first half. Julian Alvarez, who played behind Haaland, made his fourth start for the club, and was one of only three players to test Kobel - along with Ilkay Gundogan and Mahrez with his failed penalty, all in the second half. Nathan Ake headed a decent chance over too. Maybe if Haaland, with 22 goals in his first three months at City, was still on, he might have taken it.  Cancelo was taken off too, another player who will not be happy with his first half - with Adeyemi getting the better of him on several occasions out wide. It is all ultimately academic, with City topping the group amid a relentless pre-World Cup fixture list - but recent performances continue to dip below their early-season swashbuckling form. It was really competitive, Dortmund really tried to frustrate City and it was very impressive. They offered a real threat to go and win the game in the first half.  City just couldn't get in behind the defence and they couldn't find the way to open Dortmund up.  Maybe both sides didn't take risks because they knew they didn't have to win the game.

{"title": "Napoli 3-0 Rangers: Fifth Champions League loss for Ibrox side but hopes remain alive", "content": "Rangers suffered a fifth consecutive Champions League defeat at the hands of an accomplished Napoli, but escaped without any significant damage to their brittle confidence. Giovanni Simeone's brace in the opening 16 minutes had portended a chastening contest for the Scottish side, but the Serie A leaders would only add their third late on through Leo Ostigard. Rangers, too, can take solace from the fact there is some slim arithmetic hope of prolonging their campaign into the new year after Liverpool beat Ajax. That said, the Ibrox side would have to better the 4-0 margin meted out by the Dutch at the very start of this group stage when the two teams meet in Glasgow next Tuesday to reach their usual comfort zone of the Europa League. Ajax, surely, won't be as good as this Napoli side, though. Few in Europe are right now. Even with Luciano Spalletti exploring some of his lesser-heralded options, the Italians were playing a different game to their willing, but fatally ill-equipped, visitors. And the way it started was entirely in keeping with a wretched campaign for the Ibrox side. A lapse in concentration 11 minutes in. Bang. Giovanni di Lorenzo slices a pass around Ben Davies and into the path of Giovanni Simone. Bang. The striker's finish is ruthless. Giovanni van Bronckhorst spoke pre-match of his side \"collapsing\" after conceding in recent times. The memories of Ajax and Liverpool remain raw.  Time to take a breath, keep your shape, don't do anything daft. Don't allow Mario Rui to flash a cross in from the left. Don't allow Simeone to dart between two defenders and thump a header away from Allan McGregor.  Just 16 minutes gone and Rangers must have felt like they were in a washing machine. Tanguy Ndombele scudded one against the bar and Giacomo Raspadori had a couple of near things before, mercifully for the Scots, the assault dissipated.  Napoli returned to casually fizzing the ball between them, even generously allowing Rangers a turn now and again until the Scottish Premiership side inevitably gave it back.  Even when they did have a rare moment of promise, such as the sleight of foot that allowed Malik Tillman to burrow into the box on a couple of occasions or Alfredo Morelos' snatched volley, they could not summon the insouciant quality that came so easily to their hosts. The one time they did, Morelos should have scored but somehow allowed Ridvan Yilmaz's teasing low cross to flash over his foot with the goal gaping. It would be his last act. It was also Rangers' last hope. Napoli - and Simeone - had gone close to a third a couple of times early in the second half, and moments after McGregor rescued his ragged defenders by denying Mario Rui, that goal came. It was more prosaic than might have been expected, but there was still much to admire in the way Ostigard contorted his neck to snap a header past the helpless goalkeeper and secure a club-record 12th consecutive win. The Rangers players were disconsolate but, given Liverpool gave them seven last time out and there were fears that Napoli could do the same, perhaps they will leave Italy thankful for small mercies. This was quite the education Napoli offered Rangers, just as Liverpool and Ajax have at times earlier in the section. The Italians casually cranked up the pressure before detonating in a devastating five or six-minute spell in the opening quarter, then retreated.  Their work done and the group all but won, the Serie A leaders were relatively content to close the contest down. Sporadically, they reminded Rangers of their threat, but the visitors stuck to their task and even had the odd sight of goal themselves.  In truth, Napoli - without the likes of Piotr Zielinski, Hirving Lozano, Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia - were just too good. But Van Bronckhorst can take some succour from the fact his side showed some of the resolve he had asked for and return home with dignity intact.  They even have an, albeit slim, chance of snatching a Europa League place in the new year. Rangers host Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST) before completing their European commitments against Ajax on Tuesday (20:00 GMT). Napoli, meanwhile, can look ahead to the last 16 and a Serie A title tilt.  Kim Min-jae Formation    4-3-3 Formation    4-2-3-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63353343"},
{"title": "Celtic 1-1 Shakhtar Donetsk: Mykhaylo Mudryk stunner ends hosts' European hopes", "content": "A wonder strike from Shakhtar Donetsk's precocious forward Mykhaylo Mudryk denied Celtic a first Champions League win this term and ended their hopes of European football after Christmas. Mudryk - who has been linked with Europe's top clubs - charged forward on the counter and smashed in a stunning equaliser for the Ukrainian side, who could yet reach the last 16. Giorgos Giakoumakis had rifled in Celtic's first home goal in the competition for over five hours, but they could not find another. Kyogo Furuhashi had the best of their chances to get back in front, but the striker shot tamely when clean through, as Celtic threw the kitchen sink at Shakhtar in a bid to find the win which they needed to have a chance of finishing third in Group F and dropping into the Europa League. Instead, Shakhtar got the draw which ensures they will finish at least third - and potentially second - and the visitors also had the best shot at a winner when Mudryk burst through and squared for Danylo Sikan, who inexplicably failed to tap into an empty net. Ange Postecoglou's Celtic will finish last in the section, but will try to leave their mark in their final match against holders Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, while Shakhtar host RB Leipzig in the race for the last 16. Celtic's downfall throughout the group stage has been an inability to convert chances when on top alongside having their frantic press picked off later in games. But at Celtic Park there were fewer clear-cut scoring opportunities, with Giakoumakis' well-taken finish from close-range marking a more clinical start. But a well-organised Shakhtar side showed a glimpse of their threat on the break through Mudryk, who was only denied when in on goal by Joe Hart's outstretched arm just before half-time. Shakhtar and Mudryk have been one of the stories of the competition having defied expectations throughout, and all of the visitors' chances came through the 21-year-old with searing pace. His goal was a stunning moment as he nipped around Cameron Carter-Vickers before cutting inside and blasting the ball into the top corner, and he showed the same quickness when he put the ball on a plate for Sikan, who somehow missed a gaping goal with a heavy first touch. Celtic huffed and puffed until the end, but Matt O'Riley's side-foot effort wide of the post was the best chance they could muster after Kyogo shot straight at the goalkeeper, following a well-worked move. It's been a tough learning curve for the Scottish champions, but they would have expected better from themselves. Celtic's campaign has been marked by profligacy, but this was not a case of the Scottish champions missing chance after chance. Kyogo's miss was the only gilt-edged opportunity which was passed up at Celtic Park. Instead, moves broke down at the final pass or cross. Part of the credit for that has to go to a well-organised Shakhtar who, with all their documented problems associated with the war in their homeland, have been a feel-good story this season. They were well set up, and in Mudryk possess a superstar in the making who is so dangerous on the break. Postecoglou has spoken about testing his style at the highest level in order to improve, and Celtic will definitely need to do that if they get back to this stage next season. If they can find a more clinical edge and improve their press off the ball in order to stifle teams without leaving gaps, they will make more of a mark. But there are no guarantees against the best sides, and it relies on both keeping hold of their best players as well as adding quality. : \"It was a tight game. A lot on the line for both clubs. I thought we were pretty much in control. They caught us on the counter and scored. \"We had a chance with Kyogo - we miss. They had a big chance - they miss. It was a typical, tight Champions League game, but we couldn't get the result we wanted.\" \"We'll try to be back next year with more ruthlessness in front of goal. \"I had one at the end that was a big chance. To be honest, if that's in the Scottish league, I reckon we score them. Maybe it's just a bit of anxiety, I'm not sure.\" Celtic are away to Livingston in the Scottish Premiership on Sunday (12:00 GMT), before their final group game against Real Madrid on Wednesday (17:45).

{"title": "Celtic 0-2 RB Leipzig: Defeat condemns Scots to Champions League exit", "content": "Celtic's hopes of Champions League progress are over after their profligacy was punished in a frustrating home defeat by RB Leipzig. Matt O'Riley and Greg Taylor struck the woodwork in quick succession and Daizen Maeda and Kyogo Furuhashi also passed up glaring chances for the opener.  Leipzig showed the ruthless edge Celtic lacked with late goals from Timo Werner and substitute Emil Forsberg. It leaves the Scottish champions bottom with one point from four games. But while a top-two finish is now beyond Celtic, their hopes of salvaging a Europa League place were boosted by Real Madrid's  late equaliser  away to Shakhtar Donetsk, who are now four points ahead in third and visit Glasgow in a fortnight. Celtic's group-stage failings were encapsulated in a dizzying sequence midway through the first half. O'Riley rattled the base of a post with a 20-yard strike and Taylor pounced on the loose ball only to scuff it on to the bar with the goal at his mercy. Seconds later, Kyogo grazed the woodwork with a gilt-edged header from Sead Haksabanovic's delivery. Maeda had set the tone of frustration in the opening seconds, scooping an awkward header inches over, and wasteful finishing is ultimately what has condemned Celtic to an exit with two games to spare. They were eventually undone by a slick Leipzig outfit that had found Joe Hart in imposing form. The Celtic goalkeeper, who gifted a goal in last week's defeat in Germany, stuck out a leg to brilliantly divert Christopher Nkunku's powerful drive past a post then spread himself to foil Willi Orban. Celtic looked increasingly ragged as the second half swung from end to end and the only surprise was how long it took for a goal to arrive. Leipzig full-back Mohamed Simakan blazed over at one end, Maeda volleyed Aaron Mooy's cross wide at the other.  But Leipzig's growing menace was rewarded when Werner guided a header from Andre Silva's drilled cross into the bottom corner. Still Celtic had chances, with substitute Giorgos Giakoumakis unable to convert from close range. But Leipzig put the result beyond doubt when Werner rolled a pass to Forsberg, who took a touch then sent an unerring finish into the top corner. A night that promised much for Celtic ends with a familiar pang of regret over missed chances and an unwanted Champions League record.  The Glasgow club have now equalled Monaco's mark of having lost seven consecutive home games in the group stage, a barren run stretching back to 2016. Deprived of captain Callum McGregor through injury, Ange Postecoglou doubled down on his attacking philosophy and O'Riley impressed in a deeper midfield role that he's accustomed to. Left-back Taylor, too, shone as the hosts gave as good as they got for much of this contest. The stats, though, are galling. Celtic racked up 16 shots, just two of them on target, and their XG (expected goals) of 1.75 amplifies their struggles to put the ball in the net. It became inevitable that Leipzig would not be so generous at the other end. It leaves Celtic needing to win at home against Shakhtar and take a least a point in Madrid against an already-qualified Real to secure the consolation of Europa League football.  \"Disappointed for our fans, and for our lads as well. I thought we showed the endeavour to win the game, but as we've found out at this level if you don't take your chances, it's very hard to convert that into a result. \"It's been the story of our campaign so far, a tale of missed opportunities. It's the hardest part of the game, it's why clubs spend hundreds of millions on players who do that.\" Celtic host Hibernian in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 GMT), the first of three domestic outings before their next Champions League assignment at home to Shakhtar on 25 October (20:00).

{"title": "Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Sporting Lisbon: Late VAR drama denies Harry Kane winner", "content": "1342 Tottenham face a tense night in Marseille in their final Champions League group game to secure a place in the knockout phase after being denied victory in a dramatic finale against Sporting Lisbon.  Spurs knew victory would guarantee a place in the last 16 but they laboured for long periods before being denied a last-gasp winner when Harry Kane's strike was ruled out for offside with manager Antonio Conte shown a red card in the ensuing chaos.  In a tight encounter, former Spurs youngster Marcus Edwards gave Sporting a deserved 22nd-minute lead with a fine low shot as they punished Conte's side for a poor first-half display that brought loud jeers from the home fans.  Spurs were much improved after the break but they were grateful to a crucial save by keeper Hugo Lloris from Sporting substitute Flavio Nazinho, who also shot wide with the goal at his mercy.  They took advantage of those two escapes as Rodrigo Bentancur rose to head home from a corner 10 minutes from time - and in a hectic finish both sides had opportunities to win. Kane thought he had snatched it with virtually the last kick - only for VAR to decide otherwise and they now head to Marseille knowing defeat will put them at risk of elimination. Spurs were left regretting the intervention of VAR that denied them the win but they must also rue another slow start that allowed Sporting to take control for the first 45 minutes. The increasingly rebellious mood inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was reflected in the angry reaction from supporters who had grown frustrated at a series of aimless and misplaced passes allied to a lack of urgency. It was all so different after the break as Spurs came to life, finally applying pressure on Sporting and forcing keeper Antonio Adan into action. They still looked vulnerable, however, and Lloris - rightly criticised for his errors in the home defeat against Newcastle United on Sunday - came to the rescue with that crucial save from Nazinho, although the Sporting forward should have made no mistake with a second chance which he steered wide of an open goal. Spurs, having got themselves back into the game, had chances to get the three points that would have made the trip to Marseille a formality but Eric Dier and Bentancur could not find the target. The game ended in a melee, with Conte being sent off after wildly celebrating what he thought was the goal that secured the knockout place when Kane swept home Emerson Royal's knockdown. Spurs have work to do in Marseille, a job expected to be made more difficult with Conte likely to serve a touchline ban for his red card, and they must learn the lessons of being punished for leaving it late to kick into gear. It was perhaps inevitable that Marcus Edwards would score on his return to Spurs, the club where he could not make the breakthrough despite his talent.  The 23-year-old is fulfilling his potential in Lisbon and followed up a fine performance in the first group game, which Sporting won 2-0, with another display rich in promise here.  He was a constant threat until he faded after the break, threatening several times in the first half and giving Sporting the lead with a low short drilled beyond Lloris as Spurs paid the price for standing off. Edwards is now bolting on attitude to ability and will have impressed all observers, and those who remember him from his unfulfilled Spurs career, with how he performed here.

They scored 14 fewer goals than xG predicted, and as a result accrued 20 fewer points. It was clear that Potter's teams played superb football and could be capable of great things - as long as they had someone to put the ball in the back of the net. In Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Potter may finally have that player at Chelsea. Aubameyang has now scored three goals in as many games for Chelsea, netting home and away against AC Milan in the Champions League as the Blues have risen from the bottom of Group E to the top. The 33-year-old also scored against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, playing a key part in Potter earning four wins and a draw from his first five matches in charge of the Blues. \"No, we've not done anything special, it's all down to him. He has been building his fitness up,\" said Potter after the forward's goal at the San Siro on Tuesday. \"We spoke before that he came from a difficult summer so it's been a case of building up his match minutes and the more he gets the stronger he gets, and the more we understand him the more he understands us. \"Everyone knows his quality and it's great for him. He looks like he is enjoying his football and scoring goals is important.\" Former Chelsea goalkeeper Rob Green, speaking as a pundit on BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage of the 2-0 win in Milan, summed up Aubameyang's predatory ability to score goals of many types. He said: \"Aubameyang is a quality finisher, he had a wonderful finish against Crystal Palace, then the tap-in from Reece James' ball last week against AC Milan.  \"Tonight he was on to a loose ball... and slammed it home.\" Aubameyang has scored in consecutive Champions League appearances for the first time since December 2017, reasserting his status as one of the elite number nines in Europe today. He has shown how key he can be for Potter, something that could not have been taken for granted given the circumstances of his arrival at Stamford Bridge. Aubameyang was part of Chelsea's £255m spending in the summer, joining under his former Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel. A key reason Chelsea signed Aubameyang was his strong relationship with Tuchel. The German coached the Gabon forward at Borussia Dortmund between 2015 and 2017 when he was arguably at the height of his powers, scoring 79 goals across 95 games in all competitions. Aubameyang may now be five years older, but Tuchel gambled that the scoring touch is still there; his statistics indicate it absolutely is. However, Tuchel only got to use his man for 30 minutes in the defeat by Dinamo Zagreb - his final game in charge. The striker had only taken part in one training session and it came shortly after his family were targeted in a violent robbery at his home in Barcelona in which Aubameyang suffered a jaw injury. So Tuchel was gone, and as  Aubameyang's unflattering comments about Mikel Arteta  demonstrated, there were no guarantees he would perform or play ball under a new boss. Certainly he is not a guaranteed starter under Potter, who left him as an unused substitute for the weekend Premier League win over Wolves. Whether he was saving Aubameyang for Milan or not, leaving out a striker who had scored in back-to-back games was a big call. But it was one that paid off and in this Chelsea team, Aubameyang looks a fearsome proposition.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63223468"},
{"title": "World Cup 2022: Reece James injury gives England boss Gareth Southgate more worries at right-back", "content": "285 A month ago England had an abundance of top right-backs, with boss Gareth Southgate spoilt for choice. But now he may well be having to think of alternate options for next month's World Cup following a spate of injuries. Chelsea's Reece James was the latest right-back to suffer a problem, going off midway through the second half of his side's  2-0 Champions League win at AC Milan  with a leg injury. It is the latest blow for Southgate in a position where England had looked blessed with options. Manchester City's Kyle Walker, with 70 England caps, suffered an injury in the 6-3 derby win against Manchester United at the start of October. He then underwent groin surgery a few days later and is now facing a race to be fit in time for Qatar. Southgate expects to name his final squad just before the last round of Premier League matches on 13-14 November, with England beginning their World Cup campaign against Iran on 21 November. Last weekend he saw Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, a player previously called the \"best right-back in the world\" by Reds manager Jurgen Klopp and capped 17 times by England, pick up an ankle injury against Arsenal. After the match, Klopp said Alexander-Arnold's injury \"didn't look good\", but had better news at his news conference on Tuesday. \"We were maybe a bit lucky with Trent,\" added Klopp. \"It will be shorter than a month. Two weeks I heard. \"That's the information I got, though I'm not sure I am allowed to say that to be honest. We will see.\" Southgate will now face an anxious wait for news on 14-cap James, a player who started England's last game - the 3-3 Nations League draw with Germany at Wembley at the end of September. Chelsea manager Graham Potter said he would not know until later this week how bad the injury was. \"Reece, we're hoping he is OK but it is too early to say until 24-48 hours after,\" said Potter. Ex-England and Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole, speaking on BT Sport, was also worried about the extent of James' injury and added: \"I really hope for his sake and the country's sake he is fine. \"The fact we all winced when we saw it shows how important he is to England.\" That leaves Newcastle's Kieran Trippier, who has played 37 times for the Three Lions, as England's only established fit right-back, although he has only featured in two of the eight international matches played in 2022. However, he is a player liked by Southgate, who said Trippier was ahead of Alexander-Arnold in the pecking order as his \"all-round game is ahead\" of the Liverpool man. With Walker, Alexander-Arnold and James all set for spells on the sidelines, it could open the door for someone else to make a late push to be included on the plane to Qatar. Mikel Arteta, manager of Premier League leaders Arsenal, thinks 25-year-old Ben White deserves an England recall after winning the last of his four England caps in the 3-0 friendly win over Ivory Coast in March. White has been a regular for Arsenal at right-back this season and Arteta feels White's adaptability - he can also play as a central defender - could benefit the England squad. \"Ben would be very comfortable playing on the right side of a back three as well as in the middle or as a full-back,\" said Arteta. \"If you ask me if he is ready to make that step (to England), then the answer is yes because he is a very confident boy. \"He gives you absolutely everything, is always available and has the courage to play under real pressure.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63220723"},
{"title": "Liverpool 2-0 Rangers: Ibrox side must turn up in Champions League", "content": "In the opening minute at Anfield John Lundstram, a Scouser in blue, went looking for a statement tackle, a moment to show his hosts that Rangers were in town and nothing in the 90 minutes to come was going to be easy for Liverpool. He found his man in the shape of Diogo Jota. A fair tackle but a sturdy one. Jota felt it for sure. In terms of inflicting pain on Jurgen Klopp's team, that was it for the night. Rangers' hopes went up in a puff of red smoke after that, their challenge gone in less than 60 seconds.  At 2-0, Giovanni van Bronckhorst sprung his bench and had a couple of moments. Rabbi Matondo had a shot cleared away from his line by Kostas Tsimikas. On the follow up, Antonio Colak had an effort saved by Alisson. The wonder was that Alisson was alive to the danger. He had literally nothing to do up until that point, seven minutes from the end. The fact the gap between the sides was only two goals was remarkable.  That late rally by Rangers was the kind of forcefulness that they needed from the start, a difference sparked by the cavalry coming off the bench. So completely dominant in the game, Liverpool had fallen asleep waiting for Rangers to stir. That was part of it, too.  A Rangers goal would have made the endgame interesting, but they were denied that crumb. Three games and three defeats in this group now, nine goals conceded and none scored. There's definitely a \"be careful what you wish for\" element to the Champions League, particularly when you're cast into a group as unforgiving as the one Rangers find themselves in. Nobody said this was going to be anything other than savagely difficult. It's actually proving harder than that. So much about their performance had to be foot-perfect to survive and so little was. The fear was always that Liverpool would find themselves after poor displays of late, that they would climb out of the rut they've been in for too long.  That's exactly what they did, but the reality is that Rangers threw down a rope to help them out of there. Wasteful in possession and constantly inviting Liverpool on to them with their errant passing and their inferior physicality and their total lack of threat for 83 joyless minutes; if it wasn't for Allan McGregor's excellence it would have been brutal - or more brutal. McGregor, in his 41st year, turned in one of the most, if not the most, outstanding goalkeeping performances in his club's Champions League history. The only man causing Liverpool a shred of angst when the game was still theoretically in the balance was McGregor, the only one registering frustration on the faces of the home team was the colossus between the sticks.  He saved from Darwin Nunez and Mo Salah, then saved from Nunez once more, then denied Luis Diaz, then got the better of Nunez again and again. Some of the saves were straightforward enough, others were very impressive. All of that lot came in the first half. How Rangers got to the break only trailing by a free-kick was a McGregor-inspired miracle. Nunez turned away in something approaching disbelief after one of his saves. Early in the second half, McGregor made a terrific fingertips intervention from Jota and now it was the Portuguese who looked at the Scot in confusion and possibly awe. It was still only 1-0 and it was ludicrous.  When Salah stepped up for his penalty you half expected McGregor to save it, a humungous leap to the right-hand corner to paw away a thunderbolt, a low dive to his right to push away a daisy cutter, Salah on his knees wondering what on earth was happening. It wasn't to be, but it was fair enough. A second Liverpool goal was the least they deserved. The only blight on their night was that two wasn't five and six.  Can we be critical of Rangers for losing to Liverpool?  Actually, yes. There's a financial gulf as wide as the Mersey between these two clubs and a quality gap twice as wide again, but Rangers never showed up with enough intent, aggression and bravery in their play. Did they work hard enough? Not all of them did. Malik Tillman might want to review his performance more than most. Time and again his work rate in retreating to lend resistance against the red tide was nowhere near good enough.  Did they look like a team who believed themselves capable of making a match of this? They displayed little or none of that, until right at the end. James Tavernier and Borna Barisic looked terrified to go forward for fear of what might happen if Liverpool countered on them. Rangers existed in the match. That's all. Beyond McGregor, few of them had anything to remember this by. Liverpool got some of their mojo back. Given that every aspect of their game has been under the microscope since the beginning of the season, it might have been understandable had Liverpool appeared at the start in white laboratory coats rather than their famous red tops. This is a team that's been the subject of heavy analysis, everybody putting forward a theory about what has ailed them. Not rocket science, really. An obvious drop-off in intensity, the quality that propelled them to European greatness only a few short years ago. A defensive frailty typified by Trent Alexander-Arnold going AWOL down the right-hand side and all manner of attackers hitting the space he abandoned. Good players making bad errors, men who were towers of strength in seasons past reduced to anxious error-strewn vulnerabilities.  Klopp was desperate to inject authority into his team and he did it by way of a change of system. Out went his favoured 4-3-3, a formation he rarely strays from, and in came 4-2-3-1. He went for Rangers' jugular by starting Salah, Jota, Nunez and Diaz and the team found their edge through their movement and their energy. From the moment Alexander-Arnold scored it looked like there were 13 Liverpool men out there and nine or 10 Rangers players. Pressing the visitors to distraction and attacking in a blur of movement you felt like counting the number of red shirts. Were there really only 11?  Rangers will face this team again next week. At Ibrox, they may not win the points but they have to make life difficult for Liverpool at the very least. Another night of tickling the tummies of their illustrious opponents would be met with an unforgiving response from the home crowd.  The Champions League group stage party is at the halfway point. It's a deeply unforgiving place, but it's about time Rangers turned up. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63139486"},
{"title": "AC Milan 0-2 Chelsea: Blues win after Fikayo Tomori sent off", "content": "574 Chelsea enjoyed a comfortable victory at AC Milan after former Blues defender Fikayo Tomori received an early red card. Tomori was sent off for pulling back Mason Mount in the area, with Jorginho converting the penalty. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doubled the lead with a confident strike against his former club. But Chelsea and England suffered a blow in the second half when right-back Reece James limped off. The win continues Graham Potter's unbeaten start as Chelsea manager, with four wins in his first five games. It moves Chelsea top of Group E with seven points from four matches, but it remains extremely tight with Red Bull Salzburg on six points and both Milan and Dinamo Zagreb on four. Tomori has not enjoyed his reunion with his boyhood club over the past couple of games - after  Milan were beaten comprehensively at Stamford Bridge  last week, the Chelsea youth product lasted just 18 minutes on Tuesday. What looked like being a tight game was blown open when Tomori put his arm on the shoulder of England team-mate Mount, putting the midfielder off balance enough to send him tumbling to the floor. Referee Daniel Siebert, who was central to the drama throughout to the ire of the home support, deemed it enough contact to be a penalty and that Tomori had not attempted to play the ball, thus overriding the double jeopardy rule and causing him to show the red card. The decision was debated long and hard by Tomori and Milan's players, but eventually he had to leave the field and after a lengthy delay Jorginho calmly slotted the penalty away. \"I definitely don't think the referee has had one of his better evenings,\" said Milan boss Stefano Pioli. He added: \"The penalty and red card changed everything.Chelsea didn't need to play with a numerical superiority. \"I don't want to review the episode, it seems too obvious. I don't want to comment. I told the referee what I think, I don't speak English very well but I think he understood.\" Mount was excellent for the first 45 minutes before being substituted for Conor Gallagher at half-time, having picked up a booking for arguing with Olivier Giroud in the aftermath of the penalty. Potter decided to remove Mount from the firing line of both the irate home fans and the card-happy Siebert - but not before the England midfielder caused Milan endless problems and showed why he is so admired by his managers for club and country. While his form is a boost for Gareth Southgate, the sight of James hobbling off minutes after jarring his knee in the turf while making a challenge is worrying, with the World Cup less than six weeks away. Having been so well stocked at right-back previously, Southgate is now sweating on the fitness of James as well as Kyle Walker and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who have all suffered injuries in recent weeks. Only two players have started all five of Potter's games in charge of Chelsea so far - goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Mount. The latter was central to the second goal too. He was played the ball on the edge of the Milan area by Jorginho, and cleverly laid it off first time. Both Raheem Sterling and Aubameyang were running on, and the former smartly moved out of the way for the latter to plant the ball beyond Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post. From then on it was fairly straightforward for Chelsea to earn only their second competitive win on Italian soil from 15 attempts, the last being a 4-0 victory for Claudio Ranieri's side at Roberto Mancini's Lazio in November 2003. They came the closer of the two sides to scoring in the second half, with Gallagher hitting the side-netting after rounding Tatarusanu. It is a fourth successive win for Potter, with Chelsea continuing an impressive turnaround by rising to the top of Group E after four games, having been bottom after matchday two.

{"title": "Liverpool 2-0 Rangers: Jurgen Klopp's side offered mildest of Champions League resistance at home to Rangers", "content": "732 Jurgen Klopp needed something to calm the nerves and reduce the noise around Liverpool and Rangers were only too happy to oblige as they offered the mildest of Champions League resistance.  Liverpool were hardly in crisis but they have not been themselves and even manager Klopp admitted he would have been feeling the same emotions expressed by supporters frustrated at the drop in standards this season during Saturday's 3-3 draw with Brighton at Anfield.  This was just what Liverpool ordered as a comfortable 2-0 win pushed them close to the group phase, the feelgood factor turned up several notches by the sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold, seemingly English football's current hot topic of debate, showing his brilliance with a stunning early free-kick to set them on their way.  The perfect storyline would have been a goal for expensive summer signing Darwin Nunez but this was not to be. For all the Uruguayan's effort and smart running, his finishing was not clinical and was too often too close to Rangers' excellent veteran keeper Allan McGregor. Alexander-Arnold was afforded an Anfield standing ovation when he was substituted with the game won, a smile on his face similar to the one he wore as he clipped that glorious 25-yard effort beyond McGregor's despairing stretch.  There has never been any argument about that side of Alexander-Arnold's game, his vision, creation, range of passing and ability from set pieces worthy of comparison with the best.  The question marks, and certainly the view shared by England manager Gareth Southgate, are over his defensive abilities. The debate currently raging boils down to a simple matter of opinion, namely that Southgate believes he has better options to do the job he wants in Chelsea's Reece James, Kieran Trippier of Newcastle United and Kyle Walker, the Manchester City defender who offers him more tactical flexibility.  Many will disagree. Many will agree. It is Southgate's choice and he appears to have made it. This game told us nothing we did not already know.  In the Liverpool context, Alexander-Arnold's part in this game will lift his confidence and self-belief, especially after another poor performance in the draw with Brighton.  He said: \"No matter what, I always try to think positively. People say things about me but it's all about performing for the team - that's all that matters. It's about getting wins and helping the team. It's been a slow start to the season for me but I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.\"  Klopp attempted to kick Liverpool into gear by switch to a 4-4-2 system, but a very positive set-up which included Nunez, Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz. Much of the attention focused on Nunez, the 23-year-old Uruguayan signed from Benfica in the summer in a deal which could eventually be worth £85m, as he strives to get his Liverpool career going. It was always going to be a bedding in period, not helped by the moment of madness and the head-butt on Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen that landed him with a three-game ban and gave him a false start this season.  Nunez got his chance here and the battle with 40-year-old McGregor was one of the more compelling plotlines in a game that was actually low key in atmosphere and action once Liverpool went ahead.  Liverpool's striker never stopped working, his movement was good and he hit the target with his finishes. He could not, however, beat McGregor, who thwarted him three times in the first half.  Nunez was given a standing ovation when he was taken off, having done plenty right but perhaps not quite enough to start at Arsenal on Sunday. This is, though, a work in progress and Klopp has huge faith in his big summer buy.  If there was a frustration for Klopp, it may be that it took a wonder strike from a free-kick and a second-half penalty from Salah to see off opponents who were so clearly inferior. The final scoreline did not reflect the obvious gulf in class.  Liverpool will surely face a tougher test in the hostile environment of Ibrox but this was as comfortable as it gets, a late goal-line clearance by Kostas Tsimikas from Rabbi Matondo and Alisson's block from Antonio Colak apart.  For now, though, this was just what Liverpool needed. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63139340"},
{"title": "Champions League: Are Rangers 'miles off it' at this level or not delivering?", "content": "\"Are Rangers miles off this level? Or are the players not doing themselves justice?\" It was former Ibrox striker Steven Thompson who posed the question in the immediate aftermath of this sobering Champions League encounter.  Liverpool didn't so much beat Rangers on Tuesday as use the Scottish Premiership side as a curer to square themselves up after a rough time of it themselves. There was a fragility about the Anfield side, it was said. They could be 'got at'.  Travelling fans outside the ground murmured about 1-0 wins or getting back up the road with a point. It was wishful thinking by supporters desperate to see their team kick-start a group-stage campaign that might now have some wondering why they were so keen to get there in the first place. We never did find out how vulnerable Jurgen Klopp's side are though. A meek Rangers performance ensured that. The 2-0 scoreline did not come close to conveying the gulf between the two teams. Klopp said he \"didn't recognise\" there being much to separate them, but his were the words of a gracious host. One who enjoyed a far more straightforward evening than others of late. These guests were no trouble at all. \"That was eye-opening in terms of how far Rangers were off it,\" former Ibrox winger Neil McCann said. \"There has to be questions asked of certain players.  \"That was miles more than a 2-0. Allan McGregor was outstanding. If it wasn't for that man, it would have been six.\" Or seven, or more. The 40-year-old goalkeeper made eight saves, not many of them routine. One or two left Liverpool's players bewildered.  That is what has to happen for a team to survive a visit to Anfield, of course. After all, this is a club who have reached three of the last five Champions League finals. They have a bit about them. \"Don't forget the opposition we are playing,\" a chastened Giovanni van Bronckhorst said afterwards, the Rangers manager's talk of 24 hours earlier about believing his side could take something having been debunked by reality.  \"Everyone is saying, 'it's Liverpool, they're out of form'. Well, you see today the level they can reach. The gap is obvious - you have to look at the squads.\" The truth is probably somewhere in between. Yes, there is a significant disparity between Rangers and Liverpool. And, yes, the Premier League side should routinely win a fixture such as this. But it is hard to make a compelling case that any of the Ibrox players - McGregor apart - showed the best of themselves.  Leon King carried himself with admirable composure for an 18-year-old in his ninth senior game, but few others could claim to have reached the levels they are capable of. The levels they showed repeatedly in last season's run to the Europa League final. Steven Davis and Borna Barisic both spoke post-match of just how big the step up to Europe's top-tier competition has been, but the ratcheting up in quality appears to have been accompanied by a dialling down of the intensity in this Rangers side. Last term, Borussia Dortmund, Braga and RB Leipzig were treated with an irreverence notably lacking against Ajax, Napoli and now Liverpool. Is too much respect being shown? Do some players wilt under the harsher spotlight? Or has the narrative of this campaign simply been sculpted by the unforgiving knife of elite competition? \"I think we competed really well and we will learn from this game,\" Van Bronckhorst said, looking ahead to the reverse fixture in Glasgow next Wednesday.  Perhaps Ibrox - and the home crowd - will invigorate the Rangers players to deliver more, as it did for the first hour or so against Napoli before the contest was disfigured by the dismissal of James Sands.  Or maybe the uncomfortable truth is that this squad is game, but ill-equipped, for the challenge they earned for themselves.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63139865"},

Pep Guardiola's side qualified for the knockout phase of the competition after Sevilla failed to beat Borussia Dortmund in Tuesday's other Group G fixture. A dramatic opening saw two contentious decisions set the tone for the evening. Rodri's superb 25-yard effort for City was ruled out after Riyad Mahrez was penalised for handling, while the visitors benefited by being awarded a penalty when the ball struck home defender Nicolai Boilesen on the arm as he competed for a corner with Manuel Akanji. But Copenhagen goalkeeper Kamil Grabara brilliantly saved Mahrez's spot-kick to the delight of a raucous Parken Stadium crowd before Guardiola's side had Sergio Gomez sent off for a professional foul on 19-year-old forward Hakon Haraldsson five minutes later.  The decision again came after the Portuguese referee Artur Dias was referred to the pitch-side monitor and left the English champions forced to reshape and play the final hour a man down. Erling Haaland was left on the bench against opponents that had suffered a  5-0 thrashing in Manchester  just under a week ago.  Explaining his decision not to play the Norwegian, Guardiola said: \"He finished the game against Southampton so, so tired and didn't recover well. \"Yesterday was not good, today a little better but not perfect so we decided not to take the risk.\" While City saw a run of six consecutive victories come to an end with the loss of their 100% record in the competition, Guardiola appeared satisfied by a point in an encounter they dominated early on. A youthful Copenhagen side featuring six players aged 20 or under initially struggled to deal with the experience and slick passing on show from the visitors, with Julian Alvarez also close to opening the scoring. And despite the loss of Gomez just before the half hour mark City still managed almost 70% possession before the break, though the dynamic of the game altered thereafter. With Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden only introduced late on, rested for City's impending trip to Anfield to face Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday (16:30 BST), the visitors were limited to long-range efforts. Joao Cancelo and Kevin de Bruyne both tested Grabara, while at the other end Lukas Lerager's dipping shot was the closest Jacob Neestrup's side came to registering their first goal in the tournament this term.

The visitors, looking to respond after  losing to Premier League rivals Arsenal  at the weekend, put in a largely encouraging display but were let down by poor finishing.  Harry Kane was agonisingly close to turning in a Son Heung-min cross before swiping a shot wide in the first half, while Ivan Perisic saw a deflected strike go just wide of the far post before the break. But the hosts also had chances, with Hugo Lloris needing to produce a smart save to deny Ansgar Knauff's volley from close range and Jesper Lindstrom drove over from a good position. \"It was a good match. We played with great intensity,\" said Conte. \"I think we need to be more clinical. We created many, many chances to score. It's not easy to play away with this atmosphere, I think my players coped with that well. \"In football you have to score. I think for the big effort for the whole team maybe we deserved much more. The most important thing for me is to create chances.\" The draw means Tottenham are second in Group D with four points after three games, two points behind leaders Sporting Lisbon, who lost 4-1 at Marseille earlier on Tuesday.  Eintracht Frankfurt, meanwhile are level on points with Spurs but in third place on goal difference.  After losing their last Champions League game 2-0 to Sporting and 3-1 to Arsenal in the north London derby at the weekend, Spurs fans will have wanted a response from their side in Germany. Conte gave the same XI players who started against the Gunners the chance to make amends but, initially, it was the spirited hosts who started strongly. They had their opponents pegged back in their own half at times but as the game wore on Tottenham took control, showing more urgency along with improved passing. Kane and Son's link up was also encouraging with the latter providing his team-mate with two good opportunities in the first half, but Kane was unable to make the most of either of them. Spurs struggled to build on that in the second half, but with back-to-back home games coming up in the Champions League this should be seen as a good point as they look to progress from the group stage. \"The game was good for us and we played with a great personality here,\" Conte told BT Sport. \"We will see in one week [what happens] when we have another game against them.\" Luca Pellegrini Formation    3-4-2-1 Formation    3-4-2-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63080322"},
{"title": "RB Leipzig 3-1 Celtic: Ange Postecoglou wants more from callow side", "content": "If there was anyone who thought a winless start to Celtic's Champions League group stage campaign would cause Ange Postecoglou to rethink his approach, they were wrong. A 3-1 defeat by RB Leipzig leaves Celtic bottom of Group F with just one point, despite three performances which have shown the Scottish champions can spook Europe's elite in spells. But therein lies the problem. Celtic have not been able to smother opponents in the same way they do domestically, which is natural given the huge step up in the class of the opposition. \"A lot of it is experience at this level,\" Postecoglou said afterwards. \"Guys believing they belong, guys believing they can achieve at this level.\" Eight of the 11 starters in Leipzig had never played in the group stage of the Champions League before this season, while Jota had only featured as a substitute briefly for Benfica. That callowness has shown in all three matches so far, where Postecoglou's high-intensity style has caused problems for Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, and Leipzig, but ultimately it has been combined with a lack of a killer edge and mistakes at key moments. Against Leipzig, it was an error from Celtic's most experienced player Joe Hart - who passed straight to Dominik Szoboszlai to allow the German side to score their crucial second goal - which turned the game. But Posteocglou believes his side's overall approach after Jota's equaliser was more to blame. The Australian was more concerned his side were toning down the attacking mentality. \"A mistake is a mistake,\" said Postecoglou.  \"It's not about that. It's about what happened before that. We kept passing it back to him for no reason. You're doing what you think is safe but that's not really who we are. \"Once we got level we almost wanted to settle for that. I could see it coming. If it wasn't Joe making a mistake, it would have been somebody else.\" It's clear the Celtic boss wants even more bravery from his team. To get on the front foot more assertively. The question is whether it can work in time to take some scalps in the second half of this group stage. Or at all given the resources gulf. Other clubs have shown it can take time to adjust to the Champions League over multiple seasons. Club Bruges, who have won all three of their matches so far, have had some bruising defeats in finishing in the bottom two of their group in the past three seasons. AC Milan played well in their section last season after a near decade out of the competition, but finished bottom with a young squad. Richer sides than Celtic have taken time to adjust. In that sense, Postecoglou's main task is to keep Celtic at this level so they have the chance to make those improvements over time. And in the Australian's mind, getting better at this level means not taking a backwards step in the face of more illustrious opponents. \"For us to get over this hump of being a good side and getting results we have to have a stronger belief and mentality, but that's not easy, it comes with experience,\" he said. \"We need to stay really positive in our mindset and with the way we play our football. If we do that, we give ourselves a better chance. \"If you play for survival that's all you'll ever get, you never get anywhere.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63152940"},

Hakan Calhanoglu's strike in first-half stoppage time gave Inter victory. Barca thought they had rescued a point when Pedri scored in the second half, but it was ruled out by video assistant referee for an Ansu Fati handball. Defeat leaves Barcelona third in Group C, three points behind Inter. It was a night of controversy at the San Siro from VAR decisions, the most notable incident coming when Pedri appeared to have equalised on 67 minutes after Cameroon keeper Andre Onana came through a crowd of players and palmed a cross straight to him, allowing the 19-year-old to finish. However, Fati had his hand raised and the ball was pushed into his fingers at point-blank range as he put Onana under pressure. The goal was ruled out via VAR, and Barcelona manager Xavi was booked for complaining to the referee. \"The referee should be out here explaining why he makes these decisions, if he made mistakes or not. That would humanise them a lot more,\" said Xavi. \"Today I'm really unhappy. I feel there is real injustice.\" Before the match, it was Xavi's Inter counterpart Simone Inzaghi who was under pressure. His team are ninth in Serie A after losing four of their eight league games this season. He had the additional headache of facing in-form Robert Lewandowski, who had scored nine goals in his past seven games for Barca, although he had never netted at the San Siro. It is a barren run that continued for Lewandowski as he endured a quiet night in Milan, while Inzaghi celebrated a key win that puts Inter in the driving seat for a place in the knockout stage. The first VAR flashpoint occurred on 24 minutes - Eric Garcia clearly handled the ball in the area and a penalty appeared certain to be given after video review. However, a marginal offside was spotted in the build-up and Barca escaped. An evenly matched game was then decided by Calhanoglu's goal in first-half added time, his low and well-struck 25-yard strike from a central position skidding across the turf past Ter Stegen for the midfielder's first Champions League goal in five years. Barcelona offered very little until the hour mark, when Dembele struck the post with a powerful effort from the left after good team build-up. A few minutes later Pedri had the ball in the net - but VAR intervened. They could not break through thereafter, despite the latter stages being played in Inter's half, with echoes of their  most famous meeting in 2010  when a Jose Mourinho masterclass saw his Milan side reach the final on their way to the Treble. There was time for one last VAR incident when Denzel Dumfries appeared to handle in the area. However it was ruled he had not conclusively knocked a cross away from Fati with his wrist. Xavi knows the return fixture with Inter at Camp Nou in eight days' time will most likely be decisive for their European hopes this season. \"We have three more finals to come,\" he said. \"This is a game we have lost, but now we have two games at home from the three and they are real finals. \"We have to show more intensity.

{"title": "RB Leipzig 3-1 Celtic: Scottish champions' hopes dented in Germany", "content": "Celtic's hopes of progressing in the Champions League were dented after RB Leipzig eventually triumphed in a frantic and entertaining contest. Jota's second-half equaliser hauled the Scottish champions level after Christopher Nkunku had put Leipzig ahead in a fiercely contested first half in a packed Red Bull Arena. But their good work was undone when goalkeeper Joe Hart gave the ball straight to Dominik Szoboszlai, who teed up Andre Silva to score the first of his two goals. The Portuguese striker rounded off a brilliant Leipzig move to ensure the German side leapfrog Celtic in Group F, with Ange Postecoglou's team still searching for their first win before a re-match in Glasgow next week as they now sit bottom of their section. Leipzig were menacing in the final third throughout, with Nkunku denied a goal earlier in the game by the video assistant referee for offside, before the Frenchman, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea in January, slotted home as the hosts pounced on the counter. After Jota had equalised, the impressive Szoboszlai hit a post after a fantastic move involving Nkunku, and then his crisp effort into the far corner was ruled out after the referee reviewed footage of Silva blocking Hart's view from an offside position. But Celtic - who themselves created plenty of chances but were not helped by the loss of Callum McGregor to injury before the break - lived to regret not taking advantage of that reprieve, as Hart immediately passed the ball straight to Szoboszlai, and Silva made him pay. The Leipzig forward then capped another fine move in which Nkunku pinged a fantastic pass across to Mohamed Simakan to provide the assist. It was a sad end for Celtic, who until Hart's error had played well. Jota's equaliser was a well-worked goal, as Reo Hatate picked off a slack pass before feeding Kyogo Furuhashi, who crossed for his Portuguese team-mate to slide home. And before that point, Kyogo himself had a header flash just wide, as well as another shot deflected just past a post, while Hatate and Moritz Jenz also had good opportunities. But ultimately it was a similar story to the defeat by Real Madrid and draw with Shakhtar Donetsk, where Celtic were not clinical enough in front of goal, while mistakes at key moments were punished. Celtic can travel back to Glasgow with their heads held high - but with plenty of regrets, too. Despite missing their first-choice centre-backs and losing their captain and most influential midfielder McGregor, they pressed Leipzig and picked off their slack passes. Jota's equaliser was beautifully worked, and came as a result of good pressure in midfield, and they stretched Leipzig often enough.  However, it's hard to escape the feeling the team's inexperience at this level is costing them. Only two of the nine starters have played serious minutes in the Champions League before this season, and it shows in the big moments. Too often they are wasteful in front of goal, and in turn are punished for errors. Having said that, two of the mistakes which led to goals were committed by the two players who do have elite level experience. Leipzig's first came from McGregor's heavy touch on the edge of the opposition box, while Hart's pass to Szoboszlai was inexplicable at a crucial point in the game. The quality of the opposition can't be forgotten, either. Nkunku was sharp, Szoboszlai grew in influence, and Simakan on the right was a constant threat. The Germans will come to Glasgow next week with confidence after a poor start to the campaign, and will fancy their chances of putting Celtic out of the equation for second place in the group.

However, Shakhtar could not find a leveller as the Spanish giants moved closer to securing their spot in the knockout rounds. Real Madrid made the perfect start when Rodrygo struck from the edge of the box after being found by the impressive Aurelien Tchouameni.  Karim Benzema, Federico Valverde and Rodrygo linked up well for the latter to tee up Vinicius Jr for the home side's second.  Despite their first-half dominance, Carlo Ancelotti's side went into the break only one up after Zubkov headed Bogdan Mykhaylychenko's cross past Madrid's Ukrainian keeper Andriy Lunin, but the visitors were unable to salvage a point.  Shakhtar remain second in Group F, one point above RB Leipzig and face Madrid in Warsaw in the return fixture on Tuesday.

Messi opened the scoring with a curling shot after superb interplay with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. However Benfica earned a draw when Danilo Pereira turned an Enzo Fernandez cross into his own net. The result means both sides have seven points from three games in Group H. On this basis, Benfica and PSG both deserve a spot in the round of 16 as they played out a very entertaining encounter where only strong performances by goalkeepers Gianluigi Donnarumma and Odysseas Vlachodimos prevented the scoreline being much larger. The opener came on 22 minutes and was vintage Messi. A superb team move in from the right side, Messi picked the ball up and combined superbly with fellow forwards Neymar and Mbappe before curling unstoppably into the back of the net. Benfica are the 40th different opponent the Argentine has scored against in the Champions League, and this was a strike to sit alongside any of Messi's finest - but it was cancelled out on 41 minutes. A floated cross from the left wing by Fernandez, after Neymar had sloppily given the ball away, deflected off Danilo and dropped inside the far post for an own goal. The second half saw PSG apply plenty of pressure, and they hit the bar on 50 minutes when Neymar attempted a spectacular overhead kick following Vlachodimos denying right-back  Achraf Hakimi one-on-one. Vlachodimos made further fine saves from Neymar and Hakimi, while Nicolas Otamendi missed Benfica's best opportunity when heading wide from six yards. However both teams had to settle for a point, before they meet again in Paris next week.

{"title": "Man City 5-0 Copenhagen: Erling Haaland scores twice in thumping Champions League victory", "content": "1099 Erling Haaland continued his incredible scoring form with two more goals as Manchester City swept Copenhagen aside to make it three wins out of three in Champions League Group G. Haaland was taken off at half-time and so missed an attempt at what would have been a fourth hat-trick for City, but his first-half double means he now has 19 goals in his first 12 games for Pep Guardiola's side. With or without him, City were far too quick and clever for their Danish opponents and would have ended up with more than five goals from a totally one-sided match if not for Copenhagen keeper Kamil Grabara. Fresh from crushing neighbours Manchester United at the weekend, City and Haaland picked up where they left off on Sunday and took less than seven minutes to open their account. Cancelo's low cross found Haaland in space inside the area and, predictably, he made no mistake with a powerful finish from what was his first touch of the game. The only surprise was that it took until after the half-hour mark for City to extend their lead and, predictably, it was Haaland who was in the right place to tap the loose ball after Grabara had parried a Sergio Gomez shot. The last thing Copenhagen needed at this stage was bad luck but their misery was compounded before half-time when a Gomez shot took a double deflection off Denis Vavro and then David Khocholava on its way into the net. With victory secured, Haaland was replaced by Cole Palmer at half-time - even goal machines need a rest - as City cast an eye towards their next game, against Southampton here on Saturday. His exit reduced City's threat but they still dominated possession and further goals followed. Riyad Mahrez made it 4-0 from the penalty spot after Aymeric Laporte was fouled, then the Algeria forward turned provider to set up Julian Alvarez to round off the scoring from close range. City were completely dominant and will be heavy favourites to repeat this result in Denmark next week and ensure their progress to the last 16. Haaland will continue to hog the headlines but Guardiola will be pleased to see Mahrez get off the mark with his first goal and assist of 2022-23. The 31-year-old was City's top scorer last season with 24 goals in all competitions, but had been in unconvincing form in the early stages of this campaign. This week, Guardiola even went as far as saying he would not pick him until he improved his physical fitness - but this was surely the response he was looking for from Mahrez after restoring him to the team. Mahrez was not the only player to make his case for more minutes with the lively Gomez impressing again, just as he did after coming on against United, and only the post stopped Alvarez getting a second goal. At the back, Laporte's recovery from injury meant he was fit enough to make his first start of the season, while Ruben Dias was recalled after finding himself an unused substitute for the derby. With a busy schedule to come that sees City play 10 times before the campaign pauses for the World Cup on 12 November, competition for places is exactly what Guardiola wants.

A five-year hiatus from the Champions League was brought to a glittering end with a 3-0 defeat at home to holders Real Madrid last week. Plaudits were earned, but not points as the Scottish Champions then turned to Shakhtar Donetsk. In Warsaw, a  1-1 draw  was claimed, but in truth, it could and probably should have been more given the amount of chances created. But, with a point on the board, how have Celtic performed so far, and what is to come? When the group was drawn, Celtic supporters would have been salivating. A date with glitterati in Real, being paired with a Shakhtar side playing their home games in Poland, and a RB Leipzig team Rangers toppled last year in the Europa League. Against Real, Ange Postecoglou's side flew out the traps in a first half full of chances, including a McGregor effort off an upright. In the end, Real motored away, with the Celtic manager citing his frustration that his team didn't push them further. Jump forward a week and the chances were still flowing against the Ukrainians. Reo Hatate's deflected effort was the only one to find the net, though, with Kyogo Furuhashi, Greg Taylor, David Turnbull and Giorgios Giakoumakis all going close. Of Celtic's 16 efforts, only six were on target. Their shot accuracy was down at 37.5% despite 12 coming inside the box, with 37 touches in the opposition's penalty area highlighting how much they flirted with adding to their lead. These figures are in contrast to blistering domestic form, in which they have scored 25 goals in six Scottish Premiership matches. While a step up in opposition will account for some of this, Giakoumakis missing while unmarked in the box was one glaring effort which should have been converted. \"I thought second half we were really good and created four or five big chances,\" said McGregor. \"The next stage is to put one of those away and win the game, but this gives us belief and hopefully that will be there in the games to come.\" Despite coming into the group as a pot four team, Celtic would have been confident that at least a third-place finish was within reach, with RB Leipzig more than likely to get second. However, the Germans' 4-1 home humbling by Shakhtar on matchday one left the door ajar for the Ukrainians and Celtic to elbow their way into the mix. That's why there will be more than a tinge of frustration three points weren't claimed in Poland. Despite leaving it late against the Leipzig, Real are where everyone expected them to be at the summit of Group F with six points from six. Let's assume they'll stay there. Celtic's campaign will be made or broken by the time they head to the Bernabeu on matchday six, you'd have thought.  A double header against bottom-placed Leipzig, starting in Germany in three weeks, will be a key marker for Postecoglou's team, especially given Shakhtar will be in the midst of two games against Real. If they can prevent Leipzig winning and claim three points in Glasgow, it will be a significant step towards some sort of knockout football. Then it'll be up to the Ukrainians to do what they've never managed before - stop Celtic beating them at Parkhead. Easy, eh? \"Tonight will give us another bit to believe we can get something in the group,\" insisted McGregor. \"A point is a good result when you come here away.  \"Obviously the home fixtures will always be important but to get something on the board tonight was really vital too, and another stage for us to go a little bit more. \"It's just another little marker we can work towards and hopefully the next round of fixtures we can go and get that win.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62896425"},
{"title": "Chelsea 1-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg: Hosts held to draw on Potter's first outing as manager", "content": "Graham Potter began his Chelsea reign with a draw against Red Bull Salzburg, leaving his side with an uphill task to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages. In his competition debut, the former Brighton boss picked Raheem Sterling as an advanced wing-back but saw the gamble pay off when the forward curled into the bottom corner shortly after the break.  It was a much-improved performance from Chelsea's defeat by Dinamo Zagreb in their opening Group E game last week, which spelled the end for former manager Thomas Tuchel.  But Matthias Jaissle's well-drilled Austrian side got an equaliser on 75 minutes when Thiago Silva missed a tackle, allowing Noah Okafor to clip in Junior Adamu's low cross.  That goal highlighted the risks involved in Potter's positive approach, with Sterling and Marc Cucurella caught out of position. But the hosts could have earned victory when Reece James fired over from a free-kick and substitute Hakim Ziyech almost headed in at the back post. Following AC Milan's earlier 3-1 win over Zagreb, Chelsea sit bottom of Group E after two games with the Serie A champions up next at Stamford Bridge on 5 October.  Potter was appointed six days ago, and following a week which he called a \"whirlwind\" got his first taste of Champions League football, having never seen the competition before in the flesh.  There have been questions about his credentials, having managed for only three years in the Premier League with Brighton. And although it was a positive display from his side and they wasted several good chances late on with Armando Broja also firing over, he will now realise he has to quickly turn things around in Europe after Chelsea's poor start to the season.  The 47-year-old, who watched in a black suit as Stamford Bridge observed impeccably a minute's silence to mark the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, quickly established his own stamp on the team by dropping Wesley Fofana, Kalidou Koulibaly and Ben Chilwell from the side that lost at Dinamo Zagreb last week.  That saw Silva and Cucurella make up a back three with Cesar Azpilicueta, but the biggest surprise was seeing Sterling at left wing-back in a 3-4-3 formation.  That may have been too simplistic, though, as the forward was stationed way up the pitch for the most part and twice wasted good chances at the back post in the first half.  The closest the two teams came to opening the scoring before the break came within a minute of each other. Mason Mount sliced a shot inches wide of the post after another deep run and cross from Cucurella, before Benjamin Sesko had a curling effort tipped around the post by Kepa Arrizabalaga after Sterling gave the ball away.  But the England international made up for that mistake and showed why he was positioned so far up the pitch three minutes after the break.  James started the move on the right flank with a powerful run and fed Mount, whose low cross was miscontrolled by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Fortunately, Sterling took a measured touch before finding the inside of the post for his fourth of the season.  At that stage Chelsea began to control the game and looked like they would add to their lead.  However, the desire to play in Salzburg's half backfired when both Sterling and Cucurella were dispossessed near the halfway line, leading to the equaliser. Once the ball was played wide of Silva, he seemed as if he would close down Adamu and avert danger.  But the normally reliable Brazilian missed the tackle, with Okafor adding to the goal he scored against AC Milan in Salzburg's draw last week.  There were plenty of chances for Chelsea to take the lead again as Potter made five substitutes in search of a goal.  But the Austrian champions held on after Ziyech and Broja were wasteful.

{"title": "Man City 2-1 Borussia Dortmund: 'Jude Bellingham shows why he must start for England'", "content": "Erling Haaland will claim the headlines, as he has done so often already in his short and spectacular Manchester City career, but even he was swift to recognise another very special young talent.  Haaland's flying finish, executed with an athleticism and elasticity that belied his giant stature, was the match winner as City scored twice in the last 10 minutes to  beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1  and make it maximum points from two games in Champions League Group G.  For long periods, however, the Premier League champions could not lay a glove on a Dortmund side who possessed a composure, measure and style epitomised by the teenage England midfielder at the heart of their operation.  Haaland and Jude Bellingham fell into each other's arms after the final whistle, the latter expressing his disbelief and frustration at City's golden match-winning moment while the young Norway striker showed his mutual respect.  Bellingham, just 19, has shown comfort on Europe's elite stage before but this was another demonstration of the quality England manager Gareth Southgate simply cannot ignore as he finalises his plans for the World Cup, which starts in Qatar in November.  Bellingham will develop further, as is natural with one so young, but he already looks like the complete midfield player and it is becoming impossible to find any good reasons why Southgate can leave him out of England's starting line-up.  Southgate's favoured central midfield combination has been the somewhat conservative pairing of West Ham's Declan Rice and City summer signing Kalvin Phillips - but circumstances have changed. Bellingham offers everything England could want in a side in need of refreshment and re-focus after recent results such as the 4-0 loss to Hungary at Molineux.  Bellingham has the full range of passing. He has the defensive qualities Southgate appears to treasure in midfield players while also having a burst of pace and an eye for goal, as he proved when he gave Dortmund the lead with a clever glancing header from Marco Reus' cross.  The former Birmingham City youngster is also blessed with great sleight of foot and close control in tight areas and has all the tools to become a world-class player. It is no surprise that every top club in Europe is casting eyes towards Dortmund should they decide to sell next summer.  If Phillips really is a rival for Bellingham's place, the contrasts in their current situations could not have been more stark than at Etihad Stadium.  While Bellingham was the game's most significant, controlling figure until City came to life late on with John Stones' piledriver equaliser and Haaland's remarkable winner, Phillips was once more a spectator. Phillips was thrown on for Haaland as City manager Pep Guardiola ran down the clock but at kick-off on Wednesday he had figured for a grand total of 13 minutes and two games, with no starts and only 23 touches, since the £45m switch from Leeds that was designed to propel his career forward for club and country. This is not Phillips' fault as he tries to fight his way through Guardiola's array of talent. His time will come, but it will have to come quickly if any compelling argument is to be put forward that he can keep Bellingham out of England's team.  Bellingham also made a far more meaningful contribution than another England World Cup hopeful, Manchester City's Jack Grealish, who struggled to make any sort of impact before he was substituted right after Bellingham put Dortmund ahead after 56 minutes.  Grealish's lingering glances over his left shoulder as the numbers went up suggested he knew his race was run and it was no surprise when he was removed by Guardiola after a desperately disappointing night.  For a player who lives on confidence and is so clearly desperate to succeed following his £100m move from Aston Villa, Grealish looks short on that precious commodity at present.  Grealish spent too much time heading back towards his own goal, was unusually conservative in his choice of passing and his end product was lacking. It could come back in a moment of inspiration but City have such riches that he needs to find form and fast.  And then there is Haaland.  It was, perhaps, inevitable that this extraordinary 22-year-old would have the final word against his former club but the manner in which he settled this game was special even for the Norway striker.  Haaland arrived at Manchester City accompanied by huge expectations but he has exceeded them. It is mid-September but already observers are running short of superlatives.  Guardiola, so used to being asked about Haaland that he pleaded for questions about John Stones before moving on to what is becoming his normal agenda, was even moved to make a comparison between the Norwegian's goal and his great mentor and influence Johan Cruyff. He likened his goal to a famous strike by Cruyff for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid, and for Guardiola to mention Haaland in the same sentence as the man who shaped his entire football philosophy is the highest praise.  This is why City were determined to beat the likes of Real Madrid to Haaland's signature. They needed a point of difference, especially in this tournament where they have suffered so many \"what might have been\" moments, and Haaland is exactly that.  City were in danger of allowing this match to get away from them but they are carrying an unshakeable belief, bolstered by the fact a goal always seems only a moment away when Haaland is around. Add this to their list of recent comebacks.  Haaland's father, former Manchester City midfield man Alf-Inge, looked ecstatic in the stands at Etihad Stadium, although his attempt to re-enact the goal possessed rather more enthusiasm than elegance. City's new young superstar had the final word - but Bellingham had delivered an eloquent statement as to why he can now longer be anything other than a starter for England.

{"title": "Man City 2-1 Borussia Dortmund: The night Erling Haaland emulated Cruyff in Champions League", "content": "\"They didn't stop me. I scored.\" When it was put to him after  Manchester City's 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund  in the Champions League on Wednesday that the German side had defended especially well against him, Erling Haaland's response was typically brusque. For well over 80 minutes, Dortmund had kept their former star quiet. He had just 26 touches in the game - the fewest of any player. But that did not stop him having the final say. Even by the 22-year-old forward's increasingly sky-high standards, his winner here was especially impressive. The assist - a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot cross from Joao Cancelo - was good enough in itself. The finish, in which Haaland threw himself across the ball and acrobatically volleyed it left-footed across goalkeeper Alex Meyer, was arguably the best of his 13 goals in nine games for City. It drew exuberant praise from his manager, Pep Guardiola, who compared Haaland to his former Barcelona coach Johan Cruyff. In a game against Atletico Madrid in 1973, Cruyff leapt into the air outside the far post, diverting a cross into the net from a remarkably acute angle with the outside of his right heel at chest height. Known as the phantom goal, it is one of the Dutchman's most famous strikes - and one which Guardiola feels Haaland replicated perfectly. \"What a goal,\" he said. \"I remember a long time ago in Barcelona Johan Cruyff scored one quite similar against Atletico Madrid. It's nice Erling emulated Johan Cruyff. \"Maybe the people who know me know the influence of Cruyff in my life as a person, mentor and manager. Years ago he scored in Camp Nou and scored a goal v Atleti. It was quite similar to Haaland and the moment he scored it I felt Cruyff.\" On a night where City looked to be on their way to a disappointing result, it was yet another reminder of the game-changing qualities of their number nine. Haaland has now scored 26 goals in 21 Champions League appearances - a goal every 62 minutes on average. Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport: \"What I love about him is a lot of strikers would panic when they aren't getting much of the ball. He is calm and just thinks: 'I want goals.' It is all about the end product and winning games for Haaland. \"Only certain players can go into a winning dressing room and fit in seamlessly. There has to be arrogance and confidence. He is delivering so much. \"He [Guardiola] isn't trying to compare them [Cruyff and Haaland] as players but they are players who come up with moments. Only he was going to score that goal tonight.\" Dion Dublin, the former Aston Villa striker, said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Any other player would've tried to strike it with their right foot on the volley, but Haaland's gone with the left foot. It's hard to describe. He's got to be at least 8ft in the air when he connects with the ball. It's an amazing finish. \"He's gone with the correct foot obviously because it's gone in the back of the net! He's a left-footer and many times, you will do things in an unorthodox way with your good foot which makes it look really difficult, but you're more comfortable because it's your good foot. \"City were below par, but even so, they got over the line. Two very, very good goals. Stones' goal was 22 yards out - what a strike that was. \"And then you've got Haaland. I don't know what he's thinking, finishing with the wrong side of the foot in mid-air. Absolutely outstanding finish.\" For Dortmund, having taken the lead through the outstanding Jude Bellingham and kept Haaland quite for so long, this was a defeat that was hard to take. \"It was not one of those games where you can get on the ball and have loads of possession,\" said Bellingham. \"We knew we'd spend the majority of the game without the ball. \"We were brilliant for 75 minutes but that's enough time for City to put you away. \"That's what great teams can do.

{"title": "Chelsea: Graham Potter backs his players after difficult week", "content": "Graham Potter admitted he had never been to a Champions League game before he became Chelsea manager, but after Wednesday's draw with Red Bull Salzburg there is a danger his time in the competition could be short-lived.  The result leaves Chelsea bottom of Group E with AC Milan up next. For a team that won the tournament in the 2020-21 season under Thomas Tuchel, failing to reach the knockout stages would be an almighty comedown. But the recriminations can wait.  For now, Chelsea fans will be pleased that the team have responded to their 1-0 defeat by Dinamo Zagreb with an improved effort and a shift in tactics in Potter's first game in charge, which might yet solve their Achilles heel: converting their chances.  There are still some supporters who have been left confused by the decision of Chelsea's new owners to swap a Champions League-winning coach for one whose best European effort was reaching the last 32 of the Europa League with Swedish side Ostersunds.  Chelsea fan Matty told BBC Sport: \"Graham Potter is a quality manager, but we had a world-class one in Tuchel. Potter has a lot to prove, and big shoes to fill.\"  As if to underline that point, fans applauded Tuchel and sang his name in the 21st minute to show thanks for the 2021 Champions League win in Porto - where they beat Manchester City.  But Potter said he was proud of his players for quickly moving on to a new manager with new methods.  \"We're frustrated with just one point but I thought the application of the players was fantastic,\" he said. \"They gave everything and I was very proud of how they acted today.  \"It's not been easy for them either. You know, a change of coach and all that comes with that, but their response has been brilliant. They've acted really well; professional, honest, responsible. So from an effort perspective, it was absolutely 100% there.\"  In terms of taking chances, Chelsea still lack confidence, which may take time to remedy. Substitutes Hakim Ziyech and Armando Broja were both wasteful as Chelsea searched for a winner late on, and Raheem Sterling could have scored in the first half.  But Potter's decision to play the England international in an advanced left wing-back role reaped rewards when he slotted in the opener after the break for his fourth goal of the season, even if he was caught upfield for Salzburg's equaliser.  It showed that the former Brighton boss was willing to take risks as his team tried to get their Champions League campaign up and running against the Austrian champions, who drew with Milan in their Group E opener.  Asked if playing Sterling in a wing-back role was risky, Potter said: \"There is that possibility but obviously you have to organise around that and you don't really want Raheem defending his box too often and I don't think he did.  \"Whatever you do, there's always a plus and a minus. We were at home, and we wanted to be on the front foot. We wanted to get some attacking ideas in those wide positions and Raheem was really good at attacking the back lines.  \"He scored a fantastic goal and I thought he was really good in the game. [Right wing-back] Reece James balances off a little bit so we can still defend in a four if we need to. That was our thinking.\" Potter's tactics may yet breathe life into the players, and create the long-term legacy that the new owners are looking for after the hire-and-fire approach under former owner Roman Abramovich.  Some fans told BBC Sport they are also hoping that Potter can create a settled period after six months which have seen sanctions, a takeover, a record spend in the transfer market and then replacing the manager.  \"I've found a way of accepting a high turnover of managers, but I envy long-term managers at other clubs,\" added Matty. \"We will always get behind new managers, but when new ownership came in, you wonder if they are going to be the same.  \"I think Potter will do well, he just needs time.\"  After Saturday's Premier League game against Liverpool was postponed and with the international break looming, Potter's next game is not until 1 October when Chelsea face a trip to London rivals Crystal Palace.  But after the club's poor start to the season, where they have only won three out of eight games in all competitions, results must come quickly, especially in Europe's elite competition.  Potter said: \"We can't lie, it's not the position we want to be in. It will be a tough group but there is enough quality in the team and the squad to respond and we have to look forward to those games.\"  Time spent on the training ground over the next two weeks may prove invaluable.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62893419"},

In 17 Europa League games last season, Rangers conceded 16 goals, an average of 0.94 per game. In two games of this season's Champions League group stage, they've shipped seven in two, an average of 3.5. Of course, every Rangers supporter will tell you that there's a caveat to the numbers and they'd be right. Three of the seven came when they were reduced to 10 men against Napoli at Ibrox last time out, a game that Rangers were competing well in until James Sands' dismissal.  Still, it's been a predictably rough reintroduction to Champions League football, with another mouth-watering, danger-laden game to come in Liverpool on Tuesday.  A distance of 220 miles separates Ibrox from Anfield, but Rangers have been on a far greater journey than that over the past few years. Nobody should lose sight of where this club has come from, a financial basket-case, a team routinely humiliated by its nearest rivals, a succession of owners and directors that damaged the club and enraged the fans.

That's the biggest victory they have won, the victory over the chaos that brought the place to its knees. Being Rangers, though, more is always demanded.  Much like it's hard to know what to make of Jurgen Klopp's team right now - an outfit fighting to find itself - the same might be said of Van Bronckhorst's side.  They remain a curiosity, good enough to beat Borussia Dortmund and Leipzig and to come within a penalty kick of beating Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final last season, yet unpredictable enough to drop points in 11 league games.  How is it possible to concede three in 300 minutes against Eintracht and Leipzig in a European final and semi-final and three to Celtic in 45 minutes and another three to Ross County in 90? This season again we have seen Rangers' twin personalities.  They were wretched in a 2-0 away loss to Union Saint-Gilloise in a Champions League qualifier before turning it around with a 3-0 second-leg win. They were flaky when drawing 2-2 against Hibernian at Easter Road, but wonderfully resolute in going to Eindhoven and beating PSV 1-0, the win that got them a place in the Champions League proper.  They were blown away 4-0 by Celtic in the league and turned in a total shocker in losing 4-0 at Ajax. To say the 3-0 loss to Napoli in its wake represented improvement might seem odd, but it did.  Sands walked in the 55th minute when it was goalless. Napoli scored in the 68th, 85th and 90th minutes. Nobody questioned Rangers' stomach for the fight that night, as they did post-Amsterdam. And now they're heading to Anfield on the back of an excellent performance against Hearts at Tynecastle - not always a place for the faint of heart. What can we expect of them on Tuesday? Without knowing what kind of mindset they're going to turn up with, it's impossible to say, but if they are everything they can be then they can give Liverpool an uncomfortable night. Allan McGregor in goal is as old as the hills - well, 40. He waved his goodbyes to the Rangers fans last season but he's back in the team now and he's been excellent. Almost nine years ago, he was in goal for Hull against Liverpool in the Premier League. Liverpool had Gerrard, Luis Suarez and Raheem Sterling. Hull won 3-1. Rangers' defence has flitted between composed and calamitous this season. Bassey has been a big loss. The injuries to John Souttar and Filip Helander have damaged them, too.  Ben Davies, signed from Liverpool, started alongside Connor Goldson at Tynecastle and did well. Rangers folk have longed to see more of him and surely now they will. In Scottish football terms he was an expensive recruit in the summer at around £4m. Through their league-winning season and their run to the Europa League final, so much of Rangers' menace came down the flanks from Borna Barisic and, especially, captain James Tavernier. His goal tally - an astonishing achievement in finishing leading scorer in the Europa League with seven, and 18 in all competitions - has dried up. He has three including two penalties. Given what Liverpool have out wide, Tavernier and Barisic are critical to Rangers' prospects. Both can be defensively suspect and both can be thoroughly inspirational. Which is it going to be?  Van Bronckhorst is missing Tom Lawrence, the former Derby captain. A summer signing, he's one of the few who have hit the ground running. Steven Davis, 37 years young and one of the finest professionals who ever pulled on the blue jersey, started against Napoli and it wouldn't be a surprise if he was in there from the beginning again on Tuesday. The first time Davis played against Liverpool was for Aston Villa. To get an angle on how long ago that was, Chris Kirkland, Antonio Nunez and Neil Mellor were in the Liverpool team. Davis is cool and still classy. He remains an important player. Tuesday is a night when all of these guys must deliver if Rangers are to stand a chance, a night when Ryan Kent, another one returning to his old club, must back himself.  Kent has talent but his end product has been woeful for too long. He showed form against Hearts at the weekend in scoring one and assisting on another but he hasn't been doing enough of that. It was his first league goal since last December.  Rangers have had problems on the right side of their central striker. Ianis Hagi, the great Gheorghe's boy, has a long-term injury and they've thrown player after player into that position and none have stuck.  In previous seasons, Alfredo Morelos - El Bufalo - would have been a shoo-in to start through the middle but fitness and discipline issues dog him. Antonio Colak, the big Croat, is very much the man now. With 11 goals in his 14 games since arriving from PAOK in the summer, he's been a terrific signing.  Rangers fans may see this as a free hit, a game that nobody expects them to get anything from - and they'd be correct.  How the players view it is what counts. Last season, on their run to near-glory, they were written off at many turns. In that sense at least, if not in the rarefied air of the Champions League, they are in familiar territory.

{"title": "Liverpool v Rangers: Memorable games between English and Scottish clubs", "content": "When Liverpool and Rangers meet in the Champions League group stage, the clubs will renew a rivalry between English and Scottish clubs in European competition stretching back more than 61 years. A double header over little more than a week - starting with Tuesday's meeting at Anfield - promises passion and drama. Here are some memorable matches between clubs from the two countries. More than 76,000 fans watched  Jock Stein's  Celtic beat Bill Shankly's pre-match underdogs in the first leg of their semi-final at Celtic Park in April 1966, when outside-left Bobby Lennox scored the only goal. Liverpool were far more attacking in the return leg on a mudbath Anfield pitch, although Celtic held out until shortly after the hour mark, when two goals in seven minutes - first from Tommy Smith, then Geoff Strong - sent Shankly's side through to a final they lost after extra-time to Borussia Dortmund. Celtic recovered from the exit to produce one of the greatest seasons in the club's history under Stein the following season as the  'Lisbon Lions'  won the European Cup as one of four trophies. Both Stein and Leeds manager Don Revie would have preferred to meet in the final, and Celtic made a terrific start to the first leg of the semi-final at Elland Road when George Connolly scored what proved to be the only goal of the game after 40 seconds. Almost 140,000 people were inside Hampden Park to see Celtic recover from Billy Bremner's early opener for Leeds to win the tie through second-half goals from John Hughes and Bobby Murdoch.  Tommy Gemmell put Celtic ahead in the final at Milan's San Siro, only for Feyenoord to swiftly equalise and win 2-1 in extra time. A season after reaching the European Cup semi-finals, Dundee United threatened to knock Manchester United out of the Uefa Cup at the third round stage. Paul Hegarty and Paul Sturrock ensured the visitors twice equalised following goals by  Gordon Strachan  and Bryan Robson at Old Trafford in a first leg that ended 2-2. Arnold Muhren decided the tie in a 3-2 win at Tannadice for the English side, who had again been pegged back twice in the second leg and went out on penalties to Hungarian opponents Videoton in the next round. Gary McAllister put Leeds ahead at Ibrox after a minute in this decider to reach the group stage of the Champions League, but that was as good as it got in the tie for the team who had entered the first season of the Premier League as the champions of the first division. Goalkeeper John Lukic's own goal levelled the tie and Ally McCoist scored in both legs, with Mark Hateley also finding the net as Rangers took a 4-1 aggregate lead before  Eric Cantona  replied late on in the return leg. In a two-group competition sending only the winners of each section through to the final, Rangers were knocked out after finishing a point behind eventual champions Marseille. Blackburn were led by former Rangers boss Graeme Souness when they lost to an 85th-minute Henrik Larsson goal in the second round of the Uefa Cup at Celtic Park on Halloween 2002. After Larsson scored again with 15 minutes gone at Ewood Park, Chris Sutton - a Premier League winner with Rovers in 1995 - put the tie beyond doubt in a campaign that ended with  Martin O'Neill's Hoops  beaten in extra-time in the final by Jose Mourinho's Porto. They ousted Liverpool 3-1 on aggregate along the way, Alan Thompson and John Hartson scoring in a 2-0 win at Anfield in the quarter-finals after Emile Heskey had replied to Larsson's opener in Glasgow. A flurry of first-half goals provided a thriller between Celtic and United in their 2006-07 Champions League opener, which the Premier League side  edged 3-2 at Old Trafford  through two goals from Louis Saha and an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer winner. Shunsuke Nakamura scored in both group matches,  sending the hosts to the knockout stage for the first time  with the only goal of the game at Celtic Park. Celtic were knocked out in added time in the round of 16 by AC Milan, who went on to beat United in the semi-finals and Liverpool in the final. United did the double over Rangers in the 2003-04 but Walter Smith ensured there would be no repeat of that as his side  held on for a 0-0 draw  at Old Trafford in 2010-11's group stage. Wayne Rooney's 87th-minute penalty  settled the return and the man who would become the club's all-time top marksman also scored in the final as  United lost 3-1 to Barcelona  at Wembley. United swept aside Rangers 3-0 seven years earlier as the Scottish side finished fourth in the group but this time they ended third and went into the Europa League,  where they beat Sporting Lisbon  before  PSV knocked them out  in the round of 16. A season after  losing 5-0 on aggregate to Tottenham  in the Europa League play-offs, Hearts thought they had taken Liverpool to extra time at Anfield at the same stage. Pepe Reina spilled an 85th-minute David Templeton strike into his own net to level the tie at 1-1, only for  Luis Suarez to send Liverpool through  three minutes later. Liverpool were  knocked out by Zenit St Petersburg  in the last 16 and finished seventh in the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers, with Suarez scoring 30 times in all competitions. Pep Guardiola had led City to a perfect start in his first season in charge when they arrived at Celtic, who had been  beaten 7-0 by Barcelona , but the hosts took the lead three times in a  3-3 thriller  in which Raheem Sterling scored for and against his side. Celtic went ahead again when Patrick Roberts scored against his parent club in the return game, only for Kelechi Iheanacho to equalise within five minutes in a  1-1 draw . The results meant Celtic earned two of their three Champions League points for the season against City, who went out after a  6-6 draw on aggregate against Monaco  in last 16, including goals in both legs for 18-year-old Kylian Mbappe.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62742449"},
{"title": "Fikayo Tomori on how Zlatan Ibrahimovic is making him 'nasty' and how he has point to prove", "content": "When Fikayo Tomori walks back into Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, he will have a point to prove, and not just to his former club Chelsea.  The 24-year-old centre-back will take his seat in the away dressing room before AC Milan's Champions League tie, fresh from winning the Scudetto [Serie A title] last season and following rave reviews from a club that has a rich history in the art of defending.  But seeing the England international's improvement since he moved to Italy leads to two questions: why did Chelsea let the academy graduate go in the first place, meaning they had to pay £70m for former Leicester defender Wesley Fofana this summer? And why was Tomori left out of the England squad that faced Germany last month instead of the out-of-form Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire? Former Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, in charge when Tomori was dropped in 2020, and England boss Gareth Southgate are best placed to answer those dilemmas.  Yet Tomori, who left Chelsea for an initial loan spell at AC Milan in January 2021 before a £24m move the following summer, recognises he has an opportunity to show he has become a \"cleverer\" defender. Perhaps even a bit more \"nasty\" after training with team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic.  \"Every footballer, when you get on the pitch, there's a point to prove,\" Tomori said, speaking to the English media from Milan before Wednesday's Group E match.  \"Obviously coming from Chelsea and being English, there's probably that added motivation. I guess you could say that maybe I've played differently [at AC Milan] or whatever it is.  \"[The year] 2020 was difficult, not just for me, obviously there was Covid so it was difficult for everyone. I was just itching to get back on the pitch, itching to be playing, and Milan gave me an opportunity and now I'm here.  \"It's just another chance for me to see some familiar faces as well as to, I guess, show how I've developed. I know people have watched the Milan games but going back to Stamford Bridge where it all kind of started, it's another chance to show myself again.\"  Milan, who will parade their first Scudetto in 11 years to fans at Wembley's Boxpark on Tuesday evening, are a team in the midst of a renaissance. Tomori has been at the heart of it.  From being \"starstruck\" when he met legendary former defender Paolo Maldini, who is now AC Milan's technical director, through to being \"more concentrated\" in matches, Tomori feels like he has been \"born into\" a team that \"takes pride in its defending\".  \"I think I'm a cleverer defender, whether it's little fouls or positioning yourself,\" he says. \"Being in Italy, players are notorious for being good defenders, being tough to beat, being nasty and stuff like that. It's definitely something I've picked up on - how much pride, how much effort and how much detail is put into every phase of defending.\" Whatever doubts Lampard and Southgate may have, the Serie A statistics back up his improvement.  Since his debut, Milan concede an average of 0.8 goals a game with Tomori in the team. But it jumps to an average of 1.3 goals against when he does not play.  Likewise, the win percentage increases from 57% without the Canadian-born player in the side compared to 70% when he is.    Ibrahimovic is currently injured and could not train as the title chase reached its climax last season. But Tomori credits the 41-year-old Swede, who has won the Scudetto twice with Milan in two different spells, with inspiring him on and off the pitch.  \"Training against Zlatan, you can't really be too timid because if you are, he'll score 10 goals against you,\" Tomori adds. \"So you have to be a bit tougher, you have to be nasty in a sense. Obviously, having a player like him, who's played against the world's best, is going to make me a better defender.  \"He's such a well-rounded figure and having him in a dressing room, especially last season when he was injured for a lot of it, we could still see the impact he had. Just being there with the team, his voice, the way he sees the game, having him around the squad definitely helped us, for sure.\"  In addition to his assured performances on the pitch, Tomori has also impressed fans with his command of Italian. It gives a sense he feels at home in Milan.  Friends are able to visit for a \"mini holiday\", enticed by cheap flights and the commanding power of Milan's stadium, the San Siro.  Last season's success led to a new contract, keeping Tomori at the club until 2027. He says he feels \"very comfortable\" in Italy and sees himself there \"for the next few years\" rather than heading back to the Premier League.  \"Part of the reason why I signed a big contract was because I just feel very comfortable,\" he says. \"When friends or family come, they enjoy themselves here and everyone feels welcomed into the city. There's a warmth about Milan.  \"When I first came here, I really just wanted to learn Italian, to be able to communicate when I went out, and to learn the phrases on the pitch with my team-mates. I was doing lessons a lot when I first came in, but now I kind of just get by, by talking and listening.  \"That's what helped me integrate into the culture and into the team.\" Some might argue that the move to Milan has not helped with his integration into the England team. Tomori says he is \"unsure\" if more credit should have been given to his first title win.  But there is good news for Southgate. Tomori's quest for continued improvement means he is critical about his performances so far this season, and knows his best way to reach the World Cup is to continue to impress with Milan, starting on Wednesday.   The England manager will also benefit from a defender playing in a team that is still buoyed by last season's success. Tomori added: \"If I speak honestly I don't think I've started the season as I wanted to. The team has been playing well and I've been playing, but slowly I'm getting back to levels I know. Maybe there are moments in games where I know I could have done better, but it's up to me to correct it.  \"With regards to England, it's always an honour to be called up and when I'm there I just try to give my best. If I don't play, I'm going to keep on trying to stay in the manager's mind whether that's in England training or whether that's here in Milan. \"There is history of Milan winning the Champions League and of course we would like to be part of that history. Last season no one really had us down to win the Scudetto but we knew the quality we had and we worked hard.  \"If we approach every game in the Champions League like that, who knows where it can take us. For us as a team, I don't think we can really put a ceiling on ourselves.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63125288"},

{"title": "Richarlison: New Spurs signing proves he is a powerful addition on Champions League bow", "content": "Richarlison had craved the moment and how it showed as he tearfully embraced friends and family at the end of his match-winning Champions League debut for Tottenham. The talented 25-year-old had everything he wanted at former club Everton in terms of personal happiness and the adulation of supporters who loved the Brazil striker's heart-on-sleeve approach. What he did not have however - and was not going to get - was European football's elite stage, and this was his ultimate ambition. Richarlison won the hearts of Everton fans with his passion and significant contribution as they narrowly escaped relegation last season but in the end he wanted more than the Merseyside club, so often in a state of chaos and transition in recent years, could offer. It made the parting of the ways inevitable and Richarlison made a £60m switch to Spurs. He finally made the Champions League on Wednesday and what an impact he made, proving himself a powerful addition to manager Antonio Conte's potent attacking armoury. Richarlison was denied his first Spurs goal by VAR against Fulham on Saturday and that will have made opening his account in the Champions League group game against Marseille even sweeter. Conte already has England captain Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski to call on but against a Marseille side digging deep it was Richarlison who made the decisive intervention. Make no mistake, this player can be a divisive figure, whether he is hitting the deck too quickly on occasion or ball-juggling to the fury of opponents and opposition fans, as he did in Spurs' recent win at Nottingham Forest. This should not mask the special talent Richarlison possesses, bolted on to an insatiable desire for hard work and goals that endears him to his managers, team-mates and supporters. He has already won favour at Spurs and the manner in which he pulled them out of difficulties as they made their return to the Champions League will only cement his popularity. Spurs had to struggle long and hard, often way short of their best, to make the breakthrough against Marseille, who were composed and organised even after they were reduced to 10 men early in the second half when Chancel Mbemba was sent off for a professional foul on Son. Enter Richarlison with a thumping header from Ivan Perisic's cross with 14 minutes left and an even better one five minutes later as he glanced Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's delivery past Marseille goalkeeper Pau Lopez. Richarlison said when he signed for Spurs: \"I always said my dream was to play in the Champions League and now this dream will come true. Maybe I will cry because it will be a special moment. When the time comes I'll be quite emotional.\" And he certainly was as he walked over to the sidelines at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after making what was, as far as he was concerned, the perfect Champions League entrance. Conte said: \"I remember when Richy signed for us he said, 'I can't wait to play in the Champions League and listen to the music.' When a player says these words it means he has great desire and great will.\" In the wider context, Richarlison's performance and his two goals showed exactly why Conte was so keen to secure his signature as the Italian continues his relentless, fiercely driven pursuit of success. Conte may appear to have plenty of attacking options but this is a manager who always wants more and he believes Richarlison will add and create goals this season. The manner in which he decided this game will only increase that conviction. The Spurs manager said: \"We signed Richy because we tried to sign a player that was able to play in all three positions. For this reason we hadn't had any doubts to sign him. We did this quickly because our idea and vision was very clear, especially for this reason. \"Richy is more of striker than Deki [Kulusevski] but at the same time he can play in Son's position, in Harry Kane's position and Deki's position. For us this is very important because for sure when you make rotation, you don't drop the quality. \"I am happy for Richy because he deserved to have a night like this.\" Spurs have occasionally struggled this season but under Conte there is new steel that gives them the opportunity get the job done, whether it is earning a point in the 96th minute at Chelsea or fighting their own poor form to finally overcome Marseille. This is a Spurs team that is starting to resemble their manager and when that manager is Antonio Conte that can only be a good thing. Son is still searching for his brilliant best, which will surely return, but Richarlison's arrival can compensate for that and certainly did here. Spurs were desperate for a winning start, especially at home, in Group D. They should emerge successfully from a section also containing Sporting Lisbon and Eintracht Frankfurt but the first three points sets the platform and it was Richarlison who made sure they got them. He was overcome by emotion at the conclusion of this victory but Richarlison can reflect on getting his Spurs career up and running in the most satisfactory fashion.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62829438"},
{"title": "Napoli 4-1 Liverpool: Reds suffer heavy opening Champions League defeat in Naples", "content": "2743 Liverpool were thrashed by Napoli in their first Champions League Group A game on a night to forget in Italy. Jurgen Klopp's side were 3-0 down at half time but it could easily have been more as Alisson saved a penalty and Virgil van Dijk made a goalline block. Piotr Zielinski put Napoli ahead from the spot in the fifth minute after Victor Osimhen had hit the post. Andre-Frank Anguissa and Giovanni Simeone extended Napoli's lead, before Zielinski scored again after the break. It was a terrible opening half from Liverpool as Joe Gomez struggled to deal with Osimhen and was relieved when the Napoli forward trudged off with an injury before half-time. His replacement, Simeone, needed just three minutes to score on his Champions League debut as Liverpool looked shell-shocked by the home side's relentless forward approach. There were chances for the visitors - Van Dijk had a header well saved, Mohamed Salah struck an effort at the goalkeeper and a teasing cross bounced dangerously off Harvey Elliott's knee at the back post. But Liverpool were sloppy in possession - even Salah mis-controlled a good pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold when well-placed in the box - and their defensive mistakes were punished by an expressive Napoli side.  Any hope of a second-half comeback were over when Zielinski chipped a finish over Alisson from close range to make it 4-0 and though Luis Diaz curled in for an immediate response and came close with a diving header, Liverpool were deservedly beaten.  Deadline-day signing Arthur Melo came on for his debut late in the second half and fellow midfielder Thiago returned from injury to make a brief cameo, but Liverpool will head home having now won just two of their last seven matches in all competitions.  From the very first minute, Liverpool were on the back foot in Naples. Osimhen gave them an early warning when he rounded Alisson and fired against the post from a tight angle.  Napoli, though, needed only five minutes to take the lead when Zielinski coolly slotted in his penalty after handball against James Milner. A typical Klopp side would have been expected to bounce back immediately, but this season Liverpool have looked tired, demotivated and seriously out of form.  What followed instead was only humiliation as the hosts were ruthless, while Liverpool made numerous mistakes and struggled to get a stronghold of the game with talisman Salah having several poor touches. Osimhen ran the struggling Gomez ragged and Napoli could have scored at least another two goals, were it not for a goalline clearance from Van Dijk to deny Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a penalty save from Allison to thwart Osimhen after the lively frontman had been caught by Van Dijk. Former Fulham midfielder Anguissa doubled Napoli's lead in style as a quick one-two ripped apart Liverpool's defence, before Kvaratskhelia set up Simeone's third. When the whistle finally blew for the break, Klopp sprinted straight down the tunnel. The last time Liverpool conceded three goals in the first half of a Champions League game was in October 2014 when they lost 3-0 to Real Madrid. \"That's an embarrassing 45 minutes,\" former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport, Liverpool at least improved in the second half but Napoli remained in complete control. The impressive Zielinski added the fourth two minutes after the restart and Diaz's curling effort in the 49th minute was no consolation for the disappointing six-time European champions.

Marseille frustrated Spurs for large parts of this opening Group D game even after being reduced to 10 men early in the second half when Chancel Mbemba was sent off for a professional foul on Son Heung-min. Spurs were struggling to make the breakthrough until Richarlison powered home a header from Ivan Perisic's cross with 14 minutes left to open his account following his £60m summer move from Everton. Richarlison added another with an even better header five minutes later, this time meeting Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's delivery at the far post to beat Marseille goalkeeper Pau Lopez and seal the points for Spurs. Richarlison joined Spurs in order to sample the Champions League stage after making a huge contribution as Everton made a late escape from relegation last season. The Brazilian was a hero at Goodison Park and - unusually for a big-money transfer - went with almost unanimous good wishes from supporters who had taken him to their hearts. The 25-year-old was a powerful addition to the potent Spurs front line that already boasted England captain Harry Kane, Son and the talented Dejan Kulusevski - the sort of signing Conte craved in his hunt for major prizes. He has had to bide his time but Richarlison's early contributions, including his contentious ball juggling in the recent win over Nottingham Forest, have already won him favour among Spurs fans. And he cemented that status here with two vital goals that ensured Spurs came through a night of hard work with a crucial victory. Richarlison's theatrics may occasionally irritate, but there is no doubting his quality and the two headers that made the difference here demonstrated exactly what he brings to Spurs. Spurs may not have been pleasing on the eye at times this season but Conte has injected steel into the side that means they have the ability to get the job done even when they are not at their best. It was the same here as they lacked rhythm and momentum for long periods, Marseille often the more composed side in possession until the sending-off of Mbemba. He had to go and it handed the initiative to Spurs, who stuck to their task and ultimately found a match-winner in Richarlison. Conte celebrated wildly on the touchline, the manner of victory seemingly giving him just as much pleasure as any earned by free-flowing football. Spurs are a different beast under the fiercely driven Italian and here, even when not touching the heights, they proved it again.

Wednesday's  4-1 humbling by Napoli  meant Liverpool have now picked up just two wins in their first seven games in all competitions this season. Former England defender Jonathan Woodgate told BBC Radio 5 Live how Napoli had 'destroyed' Liverpool and the Reds lacked energy. Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand described the defeat as \"embarrassing\" on BT Sport, while ex-Liverpool striker Michael Owen said it could be \"shaping up to be a season to forget\". Klopp has overseen success at Liverpool since his arrival in 2015 but after a worrying start to the campaign is it time to make changes? Liverpool were 3-0 down at half-time as they slumped to their joint worst defeat in the Champions League. \"We played bad in the first half but usually we don't concede three goals,\" said Klopp, who has seen his squad hit by injuries this season and lose Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich in the summer. \"With Alisson in goal, you have to be really bad for that to happen. It looks like we have to reinvent ourselves. There is a lot of things lacking.  \"We have Wolves on Saturday and they cannot stop laughing probably. They would say - and I would too - it is the perfect moment to play them [Liverpool]. We have to set up better in pretty much everything. \"In football there are always solutions. We don't play good enough, that is obvious and that is why we lose games. There is a job to do, my responsibility and I need time to think about it.\" Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson said the players needed to \"get back to basics\" following a defensive debacle. \"We were miles too open. You can't come to a place like this and not be compact,\" he added. \"We deserved this result. You have to be ready to fight. We weren't close enough to our mates. We have to wake up and quickly because we can't perform like that.\" Individual errors were costly in Naples as Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold particularly struggled against the lively Italian side. Piotr Zielinski put Napoli ahead from the spot in the fifth minute before Andre-Frank Anguissa and Giovanni Simeone made it 3-0 at the break. Zielinski scored again two minutes into the second half and by the time Luis Diaz scored the damage had already been done. Ferdinand said you could \"see the anger with Klopp\" and questioned the desire of Liverpool's players, while ex-Reds defender Jamie Carragher described it as a \"defensive shambles\". \"The cutting comment is ' we have to reinvent ourselves' - that is a big statement to make,\" added Ferdinand. \"There are players there he is going to grill. You can't have players where you question their desire. His success is built on commitment and he is not getting that with the way the team is playing right now. \"There are not many times where you can say Liverpool lacked desire and fight and [here] they lacked all those things. Too many of their big stars are nowhere near the levels we are used to.\" Owen added: \"Napoli had strength and desire but it is a catalogue of errors from Liverpool. Liverpool fans have been expecting it for a while. They haven't been great in the last few weeks.\" But is Klopp \"too good a manager\" to not find a solution? The German boss, who has won every domestic trophy with Liverpool, as well as the Champions League during his time at the club, said he needed \"time to think about it\". \"We were not compact defensively or offensively,\" added Klopp. \"Everything is obvious but why it happened, I cannot answer now. It is a really tough cookie to take, but I have to take it.\" On the day  Chelsea sacked manager Thomas Tuchel , Klopp was even asked in the news conference if he was concerned for his own position. \"Not really, our owners are rather calm and expect me to sort the situation and not think someone else will,\" he responded. After last season's efforts, which led Liverpool to within a point of Manchester City in the Premier League title race, the Champions League final and two domestic cup wins, the contrast in performances during 2022-23 have been stark. And they don't have long to reinvent themselves as their next match against Wolves in the Premier League is on Saturday at Anfield (15:00 BST).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62828546"},

The 34-year-old Poland forward demonstrated his value by making it eight goals in five games  since leaving Bayern  in July. Lewandowski, who helped Bayern win the competition in 2019-20, marked his first Champions League appearance for Barca with a clinical finish which doubled the lead after Franck Kessie had headed the hosts ahead. He then made it 3-1 on the stroke of half-time with a header after Ousmane Dembele did well to win back possession before producing a fine cross. Viktoria Plzen had briefly given their travelling fans from the Czech Republic something to cheer when Jan Sykora headed past Marc-Andre ter Stegen, but Barca - and Lewandowski - proved far too strong. Lewandowski completed his hat-trick after 67 minutes following an assist by former Manchester City forward Ferran Torres, who added the fifth. \"Lewandowski showed his class tonight. He is rightly considered one of the best forwards in the world,\" said Viktoria Plzen boss Michal Bilek. Lewandowski is the first player to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different teams - Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. He has now scored 32 goals in his last 20 Champions League group stage matches. This result was the perfect start to Group C for Barcelona, who face Bayern -  2-0 winners at Inter Milan  - next Tuesday (20:00 BST). Lewandowski joined Bayern on a free transfer in 2014 after his departure from Borussia Dortmund and scored 50 goals in 46 games last season as he helped Bayern win a 10th straight Bundesliga title. He scored 344 times in 374 games for Bayern and is their second-highest scorer of all time behind Gerd Muller.

The Hillsborough Survivors Support Alliance fears any \"backlash\" would result in an increase in abuse over the 1989 stadium disaster. Liverpool fans  booed Abide With Me and God Save the Queen  before last season's FA Cup final at Wembley, leading to condemnation by then-prime minister Boris Johnson. The period of silence will be held after a request by Liverpool to Uefa following the Queen's death on Thursday. In a statement on  Twitter , the group said: \"Everyone attending tonight's match, please show respect and observe the minute's silence.  \"You probably think that any backlash won't affect you but it will affect us and family members with the increase in abuse over Hillsborough.  \"Respect costs nothing and that goes both ways.\" Reds legend Sir Kenny Dalglish  responded : \"Brilliantly put.

He said the respect shown by supporters to Cristiano Ronaldo when the club hosted Manchester United last season - following the death of the forward's baby son - demonstrated there should be no concerns about fan behaviour. \"There are plenty of examples where people showed exactly the right respect,\" Klopp added. Earlier this year, Liverpool said it would call on \"the full force of the law\"  to stop \"vile chants\"  about the Hillsborough disaster.

{"title": "Bayern Munich 2-0 Barcelona: Robert Lewandowski homecoming falls flat with defeat", "content": "Missed chances by Robert Lewandowski on his return to Bayern Munich proved costly as his Barcelona side lost in Germany. Outplayed in the first half, Bayern blew their Spanish opponents away after the break with goals from Lucas Hernandez and Leroy Sane. Hernandez headed in at the near post after 50 minutes, before Sane clipped home to seal the win shortly after. Lewandowski spurned a number of clear openings in an entertaining match. The victory puts Bayern Munich in control of Group C with six points from two games. Barcelona are level on three points with Inter Milan, who beat Viktoria Plzen 2-0 in the Czech Republic through goals from Edin Dzeko and Denzel Dumfries. This absorbing encounter between two European heavyweights more used to meeting in Champions League knockout games rather than the group stage was Lewandowski's first return to Bayern since his move to Xavi's Barcelona last summer. Despite a protracted transfer saga after the 34-year-old openly stated his desire to leave the Bundesliga champions, the Munich fans seemed to bear little ill will, giving the Pole a good reception before the game. Lewandowski had scored nine goals in six games for his new club before Tuesday night, but he missed several good first-half chances at the Allianz Arena. The best came on 18 minutes, with a great ball with the outside of the boot from Gavi setting him up with a volley from eight yards which he put over the crossbar when he should have hit the target. He was also denied by Manuel Neuer with a far-post header, the veteran Bayern keeper responsible for his side reaching half-time goalless having earlier saved well with his legs from midfielder Gavi. Barca were then severely punished for their star striker's profligacy with their best second-half chance falling to Gavi, who hit the post. Any failure to win a game leads to an inquest at Bayern - three successive draws in the Bundesliga has meant a mini-crisis and questions over manager Julian Nagelsmann's job.  The 35-year-old made made five changes including dropping big-money summer signing Matthijs de Ligt to the bench following his foul to give away a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Stuttgart. He was replaced by French World Cup winner Hernandez, who made the first game-changing contribution. Nagelsmann's changes did not have the desired impact immediately, with Bayern regularly picked apart in a frenetic, end-to-end first half, struggling to find the final ball when they had possession in Barca territory. The Bayern manager introduced Leon Goretzka at half-time to try and establish control over the midfield and, while it was an old-fashioned set piece which provided the break through on 50 minutes, the second shortly after came through a superb move mixing teamwork and individual skill. First, an inswinging near-post corner from Joshua Kimmich was met by the head of Hernandez, escaping the marking of Marcos Alonso and beating goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to the ball. Four minutes later, patient build-up play from the back set up a driving run from midfield by Jamal Musiala. He then played in Sane who left Jules Kounde for dust before a cute chipped finish over Ter Stegen for a superb second. It was not all positive for Nagelsmann however - Sane reacted badly to being replaced with 10 minutes to go, throwing down his water bottle and storming from the bench. The artificial turf covered doors to the subterranean bench had to be opened for Sane to make his angry exit. The trap doors and pitfalls too remain a danger for Nagelsmann, despite this pressure-easing victory. Sadio Mané", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62882374"},

Spurs had a number of good chances but could not take them and looked on course to earn a point in Portugal. However, in the 91st minute Paulinho headed in from Pedro Goncalves' left-wing corner to put the hosts ahead. It got better for Sporting as another substitute, Arthur Gomes, hit a fine, low strike to make it 2-0 and hand Spurs their first loss of the season. Sporting are top of Group D on six points after two victories, with Spurs second on three points. In the other group match, Eintracht Frankfurt won 1-0 against Marseille in France thanks to a goal from Jesper Lindstrom in a game marred by crowd trouble at the Orange Velodrome. Before the match, Sporting coach Ruben Amorim said Tottenham have \"one of the best attacks in the world\" but for the first time in their eight matches this season, Spurs could not find a goal. Richarlison scored twice in a  2-0 home victory over Marseille  last week and the Brazilian had a number of chances to put his side ahead. In the first half he had a shot blocked by ex-Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates, headed at goalkeeper Antonio Adan and put the ball in the net after rounding Adan, but was judged offside when collecting Harry Kane's through pass. Richarlison also had chances in the second half but twice put his efforts just wide. Tottenham, third in the Premier League, dominated the start of the second half against their hosts, seventh in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Emerson Royal twice had shots saved by Adan, who also made an excellent stop at full stretch to parry Kane's powerful angled strike. Ivan Perisic also headed just wide and produced an excellent low cross which Kane was just unable to get on the end of. Spurs' catalogue of misses proved costly as Sporting scored twice inside three minutes of second-half injury time to secure their second Group D win after beginning their campaign with a 3-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt. Frustrated Tottenham boss Antonio Conte, who has lost nine of his 19 Champions League away games as a manager, said: \"Difficult result and when you lose the game you're not happy. \"We could've scored, and we tried to win the game, then in the last 10 minutes we can do much better. \"It's a pity but it was a difficult game. We tried to get a win but in the end we lost the game. \"We had two or three situations that we can do much better in but now we have to rest and think about the next game in the Premier League.\" Sporting's side included ex-Tottenham player Marcus Edwards and the 23-year-old was backed to contend for a place in England's World Cup squad after an impressive performance. \"He's very strong between the lines. He was very confident for this game. He knew personally some of Tottenham's players,\" said Sporting coach Ruben Amorim. \"He has the characteristics, he has the talent. He can make it into the England national team.\" Edwards had been with Tottenham's academy since the age of eight and when he was a teenager was once compared to Argentina forward Lionel Messi by then-Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino. In 2019 he left north London and joined Portuguese side Vitoria de Guimaraes before moving to Sporting Lisbon in the summer. Edwards scored one and made one in Sporting's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round of Champions League games and again was a constant threat with his dribbling ability. After only seven minutes he set up ex-Wolves midfielder Pedro Goncalves, whose low shot was pushed wide by Hugo Lloris. Edwards then produced a superb run in first-half injury time that saw him dance past a number of defenders only for Lloris to make an excellent save to keep out what would have been one of the goals of the season. But the late goals from Paulinho and Gomes ensured Edwards would be on the winning side against his former team.

{"title": "Shakhtar Donetsk 1-1 Celtic: Scottish champions held in Warsaw by Ukrainians", "content": "Celtic endured a frustrating night in Warsaw as a resolute Shakhtar Donetsk side held them in a Champions League draw.  A deflected Reo Hatate effort had the dominant Scots deservedly ahead after just 10 minutes. But a blistering run and finish from Mykhaylo Mudryk levelled the tie before the break.  Celtic spurned several chances to claim the victory in the second half, with substitutes Giorgos Giakoumakis and Daizen Maeda missing opportunities late on. After losing 3-0 to Real Madrid in their opener last week in Glasgow, and drawing here, Celtic's tough start continues with a trip to Germany to face RB Leipzig, who lost 2-0 in Madrid on Wednesday, in three weeks' time. Celtic were hunting for their first Champions League win in almost five years. You have to go back to 27 September, 2017 for their last one - against Anderlecht in Belgium - and the path to victory was mapped out early for the Scottish champions. On the eve of the game, both teams alluded to the fact Shakhtar, playing their group games in Warsaw due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, would sit deep and look to strike on the break - as they did against Leipzig last week in a surprise 4-1 win. That approach was evident as the Scots poured forward with the energy and movement that gave Real Madrid an early fright last week, with the Ukrainians being suckered by their own gameplan after just 10 minutes. A burst of orange jerseys sprung forward into the Celtic half only for Josip Juranovic's true clearance to zip long to Sead Haksabanovic. The Swede's control and pass to the in-rushing Hatate was perfect, with the Japanese darting into the box to squeeze a ball through the tightest of gaps off the sliding Artem Bandarenko and into the net. Given Celtic had already gone close through Kyogo Furuhashi and Greg Taylor prior to the opener, they were in firm control as defender Mortiz Jenz's half volley from a knockdown was then parried away by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin.  However, just as the Scottish Premiership leaders appeared in command, a blistering counter levelled the game. A neat ball inside Juranovic was latched on to by Mudryk. The strapping 21-year-old raced away from the chasing full-back and crashed a left-foot shot high across a sprawling Joe Hart. It could have been worse moments later as Marian Shved, once the forgotten man of Parkhead, slammed the ball low under Hart at the second attempt. Thankfully for his old team, Mudryk was flagged for offside before a cute cut back. Celtic dictated most of the play in a frustrating second half. Shakhtar's flurries forward were much more tame, while their goal led a charmed life at times thanks to their visitors' wastefulness in front of goal and savvy keeping from Trubin. Jota was denied soon after the break by the goalkeeper, substitute David Turnbull arced a shot just over and Jota meandered his way through a glut of Shakhtar players before a deflected off-balance shot trundled out for a corner. As the time ticked down, Celtic stepped it up again. Substitute Giakoumakis lashed wide when unmarked from 14 yards and Daizen Maeda hid his head in the turf in frustration as he failed to turn in a drilled cross in the closing minutes. And, with only a few seconds left, Giakoumakis outjumped Trubin to head the ball goalward, only for a orange jersey to scramble it clear. It must not be forgotten in the aftermath of this draw that this Shakhtar team thumped RB Leipzig only last week. Not only that, but this is the Champions League against a side much more used to this stage in recent years. However, the Celtic fans slipping into the Polish night here will do so with a feeling of frustration. Their team were dynamic, creative and, most importantly, in the lead. It was hard to see them getting suckered. But Shakhtar did what they do so well. Let's be honest, this group is a three-way fight for second place and Ange Postecoglou will be pressing upon his team the need to be more clinical. There were enough chances to have pulled away from the Ukrainians. One point from two tough games is far from a disaster. But it's crucial Celtic convert their dominant periods in these games into goals if they are to realise aspirations of knockout Champions League football. \"They are super fast and a super aggressive team and we knew exactly what we were about to face. The pressing, especially in the beginning, was incredible. \"They gave us a very hard time, but we were supported by 40 million fans in Ukraine and we claimed a point. This game is something to be really proud about. We turned the impossible into possible, we turned the improbable into probable.\"  \"More significant than the point was the performance - and the performance was excellent. Obviously the result was not reflective of that, but they gave everything and that's all I can ask for. \"Obviously we need that second goal and we had good chances to get it. We'll get our rewards if we keep playing that kind of football and showing that kind of commitment.\" Celtic travel to Paisley on Sunday (12:00 BST) to take on St Mirren in a bid to keep up their 100% Premiership start.

{"title": "Liverpool 2-1 Ajax: Joel Matip header seals Champions League win at Anfield", "content": "Joel Matip's late header against Ajax at Anfield gave Liverpool their first Champions League win this season.  Boss Jurgen Klopp demanded a reaction to the \"horror show\" of the 4-1 defeat at Napoli in their group opener and this was certainly a vast improvement.  Liverpool created plenty of openings and deservedly went ahead when Mohamed Salah swept home Diogo Jota's pass.  Mohammed Kudus' searing shot went in off the underside of the bar to level but Matip pounced in the 89th minute. Daley Blind missed a great chance to put Ajax ahead late on before Matip - whose previous Champions League goal was nine years ago - rose to head the winner, which was confirmed by goal-line technology. Liverpool needed to respond to the debacle of Napoli and while they were nowhere near their best this was all about getting the victory that would make Champions League Group A look more positive for Klopp's side. It looked for a long time that Ajax's composed manner allied to Liverpool's lack of cutting edge might mean they would have one point from two games as they prepare to play Rangers home and away. Instead, Matip's winner ensured an important three points for last season's beaten finalists and Klopp will hope it is the start of their recovery from the defeat in Italy he labelled the worst performance of his reign at Anfield. Before the game, there was a short period of silence in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II and while there were a handful of dissenting voices, they were hushed by the vast majority of those inside Anfield, who observed the tribute respectfully. Once the action started, match-winner Matip and Thiago Alcantara were the keys to Liverpool's improvement from last week at Napoli, the defender not only being strong at the back but bringing the ball out of defence in his typical adventurous manner. The former Schalke defender's decisive late contribution capped an outstanding display and he made Klopp's defence look far more solid than in Italy last week. Thiago's ability to dictate the tempo has been sorely missed while he has been injured and his performance was a signpost to how important he will be as Liverpool try to recover from an indifferent start to their season. Klopp heralded the improvement, but warned his side there was still some way to go to recover their best form. \"I think if we put the two games, Napoli and tonight, next to each other, you don't recognise properly that it's the same sport,\" said Klopp. \"It was all different. The start was different. The middle was different. The finish was different.  \"The way we played, the way we defend, everything was different. Much higher intensity, much more aggression, braver, more ready, everything was better. \"It's the first step, nothing else, not more.\" Ajax are surpassed by very few clubs in world football in terms of unearthing talent and the latest gem looks to be Ghana forward Kudus. The 22-year-old forward was strongly linked with a move to Everton at the end of the transfer window but Ajax blocked the deal given they were about to lose Antony to Manchester United. Ajax believe Kudus will make a key contribution to their season - and presumably that his value will therefore significantly increase. They have been proved correct so far. He was outstanding in the 4-0 thrashing of Rangers in Ajax's opening group game and his fierce finish at Anfield was a sign of the quality the powerful, skilful forward possesses. He thumped in an emphatic equaliser off the underside of the bar after he was played in by Steven Berghuis and Steven Bergwijn.  Ajax will naturally be disappointed with the final outcome given they were minutes away from a valuable point, but they will justifiably feel they showed enough to believe they can progress from what is shaping up as a tight group.

Ange Postecoglou's side are fourth seeds behind the Spaniards, RB Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group F. But Celtic prepared for Tuesday's game with a comprehensive 4-0 defeat of main domestic rivals Rangers on Saturday. \"There's no reason why on Tuesday they can't get off to a positive start,\" Miller told BBC Scotland's Sportsound. \"I think, at Celtic Park, with the way Celtic are playing, high on confidence, they can definitely trouble them when they've got the ball if they make the most of it and do what they do and train every single day to do.\" Celtic have won all seven of their Scottish Premiership and League Cup games this season, scoring 29 goals and only conceding two, and Miller expects Postecoglou to adopt the same attacking tactics despite the visit by the 14-time European champions. \"Ange has been pretty clear on that,\" he said. \"We saw it in the Europa League games last season - they will go toe-to-toe with teams and the games are exciting with lots of goals.\" Miller realises that, given they are facing \"one of the world's best teams\", the Australian's side will also have to work hard without the ball and defend well.  \"He seems to have that buy-in from the players where you have a real creative attacking player like Jota who will still put a shift in, Abada who works tirelessly on his side of the field and they've got guys like Giakoumakis, Kyogo and Maeda in that front line as well who work super hard,\" he said. Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid have won all five of their domestic games this season and top La Liga by three points after beating nearest challengers Real Betis 2-1 on Saturday, but Miller points out that they \"notoriously start slow\" in the Champions League and lost at home to Moldova's Sheriff Tiraspol last season. Celtic have gone 10 games unbeaten at home, with only Rangers managing a draw, since losing to Bodo-Glimt in the Europa Conference League knockout stage in February and fellow former Celtic forward Simon Donnelly also believes Postecoglou's side can \"give a good account of themselves\". \"Celtic going into it on the high of a 4-0 win against Rangers, the place is going to be jumping on Tuesday night,\" he added. \"With their attacking prowess, they can hurt Real Madrid. The test will be can they keep the likes of Karim Benzema, Vinicius Jr and Luka Modric at bay?\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62783340"},
{"title": "Champions League: Can Celtic remain self-assured and Rangers resilient in top-table return?", "content": "For Celtic and Rangers, it's been a while. It's knocking on for five years since the Parkhead team last breathed the rarefied air of a Champions League group stage match and closer to 12 years since the Ibrox side did it.  Darren Cole and Kyle Hutton started in Rangers' last game at this level - Jordan McMillan came off the bench. It was a 1-1 draw away to Bursaspor in early December 2010. Kenny Miller scored the Rangers goal. You might say that things got pretty interesting at Ibrox fairly soon after that.  If Celtic's most recent experience doesn't quite feel like a million years ago, they still had a centre-back pairing of Jozo Simunovic and Dedryck Boyota on the night of their last nod in a Champions League group game, a 1-0 home defeat by Anderlecht in December 2017.   A teenage Odsonne Edouard came off the bench. Liel Abada had just turned 16. The 17-year-old Matt O'Riley had not long played his first senior game of football, an EFL Cup tie for Fulham against Wycombe Wanderers.  Celtic host Real Madrid on Tuesday night and Rangers play Ajax in Amsterdam on Wednesday. As intoxicating as this Celtic game will be for the home side, it's also going to have a huge resonance for those who have Real in their hearts.  Glasgow is a city that is at the centre of their epic European story, the place where Puskas and Di Stefano, Santamaria and Del Sol put on the greatest show on earth in the 1960 European Cup final.  These days, the Champions League is so much about participation fees and television rights and gate receipts - all the financial trappings of a fiscal freak show - but back then it was about glory and little else. Madrid fans of a certain age will travel to Glasgow thinking in part about their dominant present but also of their beautiful past.  So this will be special. What's utterly compelling from a Celtic point of view is the question of how their team will look when going up against the biggest of the big boys. Can they cause the great Real some trouble? Can Ange Postecoglou's team - inventive, pacy and dangerous in domestic stuff - bring any of that to bear against the greatest club side most of them will ever have faced. In many senses, it's a free hit. Nobody really expects a Celtic victory, or even a Celtic draw, but how they cope will be pulse-quickening on the night. Can Jota get change out of five-time Champions League winner Dani Carvajal? Can Abada give an uncomfortable night to his £50m opposite number, Ferland Mendy? Madrid beat Real Betis 2-1 at the weekend with a midfield three of the great Luka Modric, the brilliant young Frenchman, Aurelien Tchouameni, and the teenage wonder Eduardo Camavinga. These are the replacements for the departed old guard, Isco and Casemiro among them. Can Callum McGregor, Reo Hatate and O'Riley put a dent in them? Can the Celtic defence somehow survive the speed and power and towering world class of Vinicius Junior and Karim Benzema? It's the chance to find out that's the thrill in all of this.  Postecoglou's team are a proven outfit in Scottish football, but they're an unknown entity in the truly big time. These upcoming games in the Champions League will be a terrific barometer of where they're at.  Celtic have not won a home group game in this tournament in seven attempts, albeit against the heaviest hitters. That all seems an eternity ago though. Indeed, the season before Postecoglou arrived feels like a different dimension in time given the changes he's brought in.  Can they get something on Tuesday? Well, Sheriff Tiraspol did last season, beating Real in Madrid in round two. Shakhtar Donetsk beat them home and away the season before, while Borussia Monchengladbach held them, as did Club Brugge the season before that. CSKA Moscow did them twice a year prior.  It can be done. Not often. Not unless you are foot-perfect, but others have shown the way.  Celtic are going into Tuesday on a wave of self-belief. Rangers are going to Amsterdam under a cloud. Any Old Firm shellacking does tend to set the hair on fire among the vanquished and the aftermath of their 4-0 hammering on Saturday has been no exception.  Goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin has been getting it, the centre-backs have been getting it, the midfielders have come in for stick, Ryan Kent has been lacerated, manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst has been questioned heavily, the recruitment has been pored over with a merciless eye. The anger is understandable. Rangers were out-played to an embarrassing degree.  They remain an enigma. Last season, they went all the way to the Europa League final, beating stellar sides along the way, and yet dropped points in 11 of their 38 league games and got dumped out of the League Cup by Hibernian.  The team that beat Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and came within a penalty kick of beating Eintracht Frankfurt in the final toiled on the home front. The split personality remains. They put PSV Eindhoven out of the Champions League in a display of organisation, hard work and ruthlessness and yet none of those qualities accompanied them to Celtic Park on Saturday. You'd trust Rangers in European football way more than in Scottish football, which is a surreal thing to say. Ajax, in the Johan Cruyff Arena, is fantastically glamorous and it's entirely possible, given their nature, that they will follow up the 4-0 with something substantial on Wednesday. Maybe not a win or a draw, but some pride restored. Ajax's policy of nurturing and then selling quality is jaw-dropping. Sebastian Haller scored in every round of the Champions League group stage last season, but he went to Dortmund for £27m. Lisandro Martinez and Antony both went to Manchester United for a combined £130m. Ryan Gravenbach went to Bayern Munich for a humble £16m.  In the two seasons before this one, they sold Donny van de Beek, Sergino Dest, Hakim Ziyech, Sven Botman, Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt for around £230m. They're one of the most extraordinary clubs in the global game. They've not exactly sat on their hands on the recruitment front, Calvin Bassey being a subplot given his move from Rangers to Ajax in the summer. Just as the months ahead will tell us something about Postecoglou's ability to make his domestic destroyers into a team that can ask questions of the best in Europe, we'll also discover more about this Rangers side.  They'll need that resilience on the road this week. Before that, back in Glasgow on Tuesday, never mind checking the weather forecast. Bank on thunder.

{"title": "Champions League group stage: Quick reunions, nightmare groups and an all-British drama", "content": "686 \"The Chaaaaaaaampions...\" It's that time of the year again when that famous anthem starts ringing around stadiums of the elite as the Champions League returns. The group stage of this season's competition gets under way this week and BBC Sport takes a look at some of the things to watch out for. Erling Haaland has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water and needed just four games to hit his first hat-trick for Manchester City when they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace last month. The Norway international left Borussia Dortmund for City in the summer and the Champions League group-stage draw has ensured he has a quick reunion with his former side.  City's first game is at Sevilla this week but next week Dortmund will be the visitors at Etihad Stadium. Champions League success has eluded City but manager Pep Guardiola is hoping Haaland will continue his super record in European club competitions, having scored 27 goals in 25 appearances for Molde, Salzburg and Dortmund. Like Haaland, former Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski will also come up against the side he left this summer - in his case, Barcelona. After hosting Czech side Viktoria Plzen on Wednesday, Lewandowski and Barcelona head to Munich on Tuesday, 13 September. Italian side Inter Milan complete what is comfortably the toughest group in this season's competition. Lewandowski scored 67 goals in the Champions League for Bayern, but former Liverpool striker Sadio Mane seems to be doing a pretty good job so far of filling the Poland forward's boots, having scored five goals in seven appearances in German league and cup games. One of the most eye-catching draws of the group stage was in Group A, where 2021-22 finalists Liverpool and Scottish side Rangers will face each other.  The two sides will meet for the first time in this season's competition on 4 October at Anfield and then on 12 October at Ibrox. Rangers' return to the Champions League for the first time since 2010, while they and Celtic are back in it together for the first time since 2007. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to the suspension of all football in the country, but the Ukrainian Premier League returned to action last month and Shakhtar Donetsk are participating in this season's Champions League. They have been drawn with the defending champions Real Madrid in Group D, along with RB Leipzig and Celtic. Shakhtar will play their home games in Poland, at Legia Warsaw's Stadion Wojska Polskiego, which is almost 1,000 miles away from Donetsk. They begin their Champions League campaign at Leipzig in Germany on Tuesday night but their first 'home' game is against Celtic on Wednesday, 14 September, and they are being well backed by Polish fans  after 18,000 tickets for the game were sold in one day. Paris St-Germain, among the favourites to win the Champions League, go up against Juventus. Both sides will be wanting to get to the business end of the tournament and, like Haaland and Lewandowski, Juventus winger Angel di Maria will have an early reunion with his former side as he returns to the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Di Maria's team-mate and one-time Manchester United target Adrien Rabiot also faces his former club. According to data specialists Nielsen Gracenote, Real Madrid are favourites to win this season's Champions League.  Gracenote's Euro Club Index simulations give Real a 21% chance of lifting the trophy next May. Manchester City (20%), Liverpool (19%) and Bayern Munich (10%) are the other main contenders. There is a 60% chance of Manchester City or one of last season's two finalists, Real Madrid and Liverpool, winning this season's competition.  Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: \"With the competition not yet under way, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Liverpool already have more than a 90% chance of reaching this season's Champions League knockout phase. Real Madrid's chance of negotiating the group phase is as high as 98% before a ball is kicked. \"Along with that trio, Chelsea, Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich all have more than 80% chance of progressing to the knockout phase.\" If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62703822"},
{"title": "Champions League: How Neymar, Mbappe & Messi are finally thriving at PSG", "content": "On 10 August 2021, the footballing world drew a collective gasp of breath as Lionel Messi joined Paris St-Germain. It was always assumed that Messi and Barcelona had an unbreakable bond, but the Catalan club's financial situation dictated otherwise and it led to the formation of a star-studded attacking trident, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe already in the French capital.  Things did not go smoothly during their first season together in Paris though and, despite winning the league, the trio struggled to perform as a cohesive unit that maximised each other's talents.  This culminated in a Champions League last-16 exit at the hands of Real Madrid.  PSG only scored two goals in 180 minutes, which both originated from Mbappe's individual speed and brilliance, rather than any move involving himself, Neymar and Messi. Former boss Mauricio Pochettino's tactical set-up was seen a major contributor to this, with a reluctance from the Argentine coach to deviate from a 4-3-3 system, leaving 35-year-old Messi and Neymar, 30, in the wide forward roles - not ideal for players lacking explosive page at this stage of their careers. So, before PSG's Champions League opener at home to Juventus on Tuesday, what has changed since Pochettino's departure? And could the summer arrival of former Lille and Nice coach Christophe Galtier finally help end their wait for Champions League success? Messi, Neymar and Mbappe have made an explosive start to the new campaign, with 32 goals and assists between them already this season, as they relish Galtier's 3-4-3 formation. Neymar and Messi have already got 22 goals and assists after six games this campaign, compared to just 36 in all of last season. With Sergio Ramos and Marquinhos' range of passing and Presnel Kimpembe's ability to carry the ball into midfield, PSG possess three centre-backs who provide the perfect platform to play possession-based football.  The system also meshes well with the style of their wing-backs. Nuno Mendes and Achraf Hakimi are explosive athletes who flourish when allowed to charge forward and carry the ball into the final third.  Unburdening them from deeper defensive responsibilities, with three centre-backs behind them, allows them this freedom. In front of the three centre-backs is a midfield double pivot. Galtier seems to have settled on a first-choice pairing of club stalwart Marco Verratti alongside new signing Vitinha, who had a spell with Wolves in the Premier League.  Verratti (averaging 83 passes per game) is given the responsibility to dictate the majority of play from a deeper position while Vitinha (52 passes per game) is often encouraged to push higher up the pitch and initiate combination play with the wing-backs and front three.  This midfield dynamic has ensured the front three are not disconnected from the rest of the team's build-up.  While PSG's wing-backs are allowed to get high up the pitch, Galtier also wants them to stay wide and focus on stretching the pitch to create space, rather than moving infield.  The positional freedom is afforded to the players inside of the wing-backs: Neymar, Mbappe and Messi. The width provided by the wing-backs means that PSG's star attacking trio can now play closer to each other and combine.  All three players have immense technical quality, which has led to some mesmerising final-third moves.  Messi and Neymar now both have six assists each in the league this season - that places them as the top two assist makers from all of Europe's top five leagues. The level of the trio's central combination play is so high that inevitably there are phases of play when the opposition defence are drawn in towards them. This creates space on the flanks for their rapid wing-backs to exploit.  The formation has also enhanced PSG's counter-attacking threat. Neymar and Messi are now often positioned centrally when opposition moves break down.  This results in them picking up the ball in midfield areas and quickly launching accurate passes to find Mbappe's lightning-quick runs in-behind defences. The other aspect of PSG's play that has changed with Galtier's tactics is their pressing.  Instead of asking the front three to cover large distances in Pochettino's previous 4-3-3, Mbappe, Neymar and Messi's off-ball roles are now confined to pressing opposition centre-backs and the defensive midfielder.  The pressing of the opposition full-backs is now left to the PSG wing-backs. This helps conserve the energy of the ageing Neymar and Messi for their on-ball activities, and also strengthens PSG's defensive structure. PSG have already scored three goals this season from Hakimi pressing high from right wing-back and disrupting attacks.  Furthermore, if the opposition overloads a flank with two players, PSG can now fall back into a flat back five to enable the wing-back and wide centre-back to cover them, rather than asking Neymar and Messi to track all the way back into their own half. Juventus' visit to the Parc des Princes on Tuesday will be Galtier's biggest test yet to see if their Ligue 1 performances can translate to the Champions League.  Galtier has provided the tactical structure for PSG's famous front three to combine. Now it is up to the individuals to perform.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62802421"},
{"title": "Champions League: Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti 'not surprised' holders are 'underdogs'", "content": "295 Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti is \"not surprised\" the bookmakers make his holders only fifth favourites to win this season's Champions League. Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain, Manchester City and Liverpool are all more fancied as Real open their defence against Celtic in Group F on Tuesday. Ancelotti was reminded that the 14-time European champions were also considered \"underdogs\" last season. \"If anything, it is a good sign,\" the Italian replied.  \"We don't mind being the underdogs and, if anything, we've improved.\" Veteran Brazil full-back Marcelo was among a handful of summer departures, while only France midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni and Germany centre-half Antonio Rudiger have arrived from Monaco and Chelsea respectively. However, Madrid already lead La Liga by two points after four straight victories, including a 2-1 defeat of early challengers Real Betis on Saturday. Ancelotti's side visit a Celtic side who themselves have won all seven of their domestic games this season, culminating in a 4-0 dismissal of closest rivals Rangers, and he dismissed the suggestion that the draw had been kind to his side. \"It's not an easy group at all,\" he said. \"Celtic, first and foremost, are a strong side and we also have to respect RB Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk. There can also be surprises in the group. Think about last year with Sheriff - anything can happen.\" In addition to that shock group-stage defeat at home to the Moldovans, Ancelotti's experience of Celtic Park as a manager is three visits, no wins. AC Milan, whom he led to his first two Champions league triumphs before repeating that feat with Real, were twice held to goalless draws with Ancelotti at the helm, including a last-16 tie that ultimately went to extra-time before his side went on to win the competition in 2007. Months later, the holders went down 2-1 in a group-stage game following Scott McDonald's late winner. \"It's true, it's a very difficult stadium for me and for my teams in the past,\" he said. \"But a fantastic atmosphere.\" Ancelotti is expecting another tough test faced with the \"intensity\" of Celtic's play under manager Ange Postecoglou but is hopeful of an invite to what he expects to be \"a big party\" when Real's evergreen Croatia midfielder, Luka Modric, celebrates his 37th birthday on Friday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62799290"},

{"title": "Ajax v Rangers: Can Dutch giants build again after Antony & Ten Hag exit?", "content": "Standing at the foot of a never-ending staircase leading to the heavens, the monochrome surroundings are a pilgrimage to legend. A giant 14 is emblazoned on the wall to the left. Adjacent is a mammoth black and white mural of a face adorning what feels like every wall in the place. In front, a bronze statue is sculpted in the image of the same man. Johan Cruyff.  The stadium now carries his name, the iconic venue now a shrine to past glories and moments of magic from the Dutch great. While the stadium's grand entrance is a nod back to a wondrous and glorious past, once again Ajax are gazing into the future through a fresh lens. A new manager and a new rake of players have arrived, searching for more glory. But, as they prepare to kick-start their Champions League campaign, how will the Eredivisie champions fare? The old mantra of \"it's better to have loved and lost…\" will have been used more than a bicycle puncture repair kit around these parts in recent years as Ajax fans console themselves over the players who have ridden off into the great beyond. Frenkie de Jong, Matthijs de Ligt, Kasper Dolberg, Hakim Ziyech, Donny van de Beek and more have all left for big clubs and for big money. A glance through the ins and outs over the last five years and you'll see Ajax is not a club which stands still. Yet the departure of three-time title-winning Erik ten Hag for Manchester United was a body blow. So was the loss of Brazilian forward Antony, who followed his coach to Old Trafford in acrimonious circumstances.  Lisandro Martinez had already gone to Manchester. And right-back Noussair Mazraoui had left for Bayern Munich. \"A lot of fans were unhappy about how much the club cares about finances,\" Finley Crebolder, the editor of Get Belgium & Dutch Football News, told BBC Scotland.  \"In their heads, Ajax already had a pretty good summer financially. They've already sold some players for a lot of money so they didn't want [Antony] to leave. \"They showed how reluctant they were to let Antony go and the they didn't let Edson Alvarez go to Chelsea. They are trying to change this reputation they have as a selling club.\" While the Ajax board - led by former player Edwin van der Sar - have cashed in big time over the summer, they've also not been shy at spending, either. Tens of millions of Euro have been thrown at giving new coach Alfred Schreuder a chance of building on the legacy of his predecessor.  Calvin Bassey was brought in from Rangers for a fee expected to top £20m; Brian Brobbey has come in from RB Leipzig midfield; and defender Jorge Sanchez has been lured from Club America. However, the shrewdest piece of business might be the acquisition of Steven Bergwijn from Tottenham for over 30m Euro. Such has been the Dutch international's early impact, with six goals in five matches, that Antony has yet to be truly missed. \"They are definitely a weaker team,\" says Crebolder. \"You've got the players who have left and the one that's hardest to replace is Mazraoui. They've not replaced him at all. But Antony isn't such a big loss because Bergwijn has compensated.\" It is early days, but there is optimism around what is being built by Schreuder.  After all, this is Ajax. The footballing philosophy runs deep here. Patience, possession and panache are all cornerstones and, under the 49-year-old, that's unlikely to change. A former assistant to Ten Hag, the man who won the Belgian title last season with Club Brugge is familiar with the demands and responsibility. A gaze up at the wall now and then will do that.  A 5-3 Dutch Super Cup defeat to PSV Eindhoven was far from the ideal start, but five straight wins have more than steadied the ship with heavy beatings meted out to Groningen and Cambuur in the process. In the league, Ajax have completed the most 10-pass sequences (83), have the highest average possession (69%), with an xG of 4.25. Defensively, they have faced the most shots (35), but only conceded three goals. Impressive, yes, but the group is still a work in progress.  It is far too early to know if the bright early start can be maintained, while former Netherlands great Rafael van der Vaart has been critical of captain Dusan Tadic, reportedly describing him as \"hopelessly out of form\". But there is a quiet confidence about the Dutch giants still, even if pragmatism may well be the word whispered in the Cruyff corridors as the Schreuder era commences.  \"We have a good squad, very competitive,\" the coach said on Tuesday. \"We've had a lot of changes and it takes a bit of time to get them in the system we want. But the first 11 we had last week have been here longer, but we now have new players.  \"They know how Ajax is playing coming from different countries, but in the end I think our squad is good enough to get a good season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62759916"},
{"title": "Celtic v Real Madrid: Can hosts frustrate Carlo Ancelotti again in Champions League?", "content": "The caption was concise: 'The boss.' Puffing on a cigar and wearing shades, Carlo Ancelotti exuded effortless cool in a photo that went viral of the Real Madrid manager celebrating La Liga title success with a quartet of players in May. The latest trophy in his collection burnished an already glittering CV. In his first year back in Madrid, Ancelotti had become the only coach to have won the title in each of Europe's 'big five' leagues. For good measure he added the Champions League a few weeks later, a record-extending 14th crown for Real and an unprecedented fourth for the 63-year-old, with two apiece at the Spanish giants and AC Milan. And that's without even mentioning the two he won as a Milan player. Yet amid the glut of honours and personal accolades in a storied career, a curious anomaly remains. Ancelotti has never won at Celtic Park, having tried and failed on three occasions with Milan. It's an itch he gets the opportunity to scratch on Tuesday when he brings all-conquering Real to Glasgow for a Champions League group opener that has the city - well, half of it at least - abuzz with excitement. Ancelotti explained the cigar-toting picture, posted on Twitter by forward Vinicius Junior, thus: \"No, I don't smoke cigars. It was only a photo with my friends. Yes, these players are my friends.\" And therein lies one of the tenets of the Italian's philosophy that has given him longevity at the very peak of the game. Players genuinely like him, as a person not just a manager. They want to play for him. Ancelotti eschews a dictatorial approach - one artfully arched eyebrow can speak a thousand words - and encourages collective responsibility. Englishman Paul Clement knows the Italian's methods in intricate detail, having served as his assistant at Chelsea, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid first time round (2013-15) and Bayern Munich. Clement praises Ancelotti as \"by far the greatest influence on my career\" and provided insight into his man-management to  Coaches' Voice  in 2019. The scene was the night before the 2010 FA Cup final as Chelsea, having sealed the title with an 8-0 thrashing of Wigan and eyeing a first-ever FA Cup and league double, prepared to face Portsmouth. \"The room fell silent,\" said Clement. \"Every player was suddenly rendered mute by a question they'd never had to answer before. \"'This is the last game of the season [Ancelotti said]. We know what we're able to do and we know the opposition. What do you think the tactics should be?' \"Carlo's question silenced a group of players not renowned for being shy. They weren't used to being asked for their thoughts; their ideas. But, gradually, baffled expressions turned into ones of contemplation, and then the hands went up. \"Before you knew it, we had a list of defending points and a list of attacking ones. That was it. The tactics were decided; the team talk was done and the next day the players delivered. A 1-0 victory; a historic double; a player-led approach. \"Sometimes coaches are scared to give that responsibility to the players. But ultimately that's what it's all about.\" That ethos was also evident in Real's semi-final against Manchester City last season, with midfielder Toni Kroos revealing he helped advise Ancelotti who to bring off the bench to spark their  incredible comeback. Yet Kroos bristles at suggestions Ancelotti's laissez-faire outlook is not complemented by a sharp tactical mind. \"I saw the same with [Jupp] Heynckes,\" Kroos said on the eve of last season's final. \"It's a shame Heynckes and Ancelotti are reduced to being 'wardrobe managers'. I don't think that does them justice. It sounds like they don't know about tactics. \"They are very clear about how they want their teams to play, in both defence and attack. That's often left out when people talk about them.\" Clement added: \"As a coach, Carlo taught me an incredible amount. But equally important is what I learned from him as a person. I watched how he dealt with people and relationships. He made players feel comfortable. He got the best out of them.\" Thirty years on from his first coaching role as Italy assistant, Ancelotti's approach continues to reap rewards. Having begun the season by winning the European Super Cup and opening La Liga with four straight victories, Real's band of superstars descend on Glasgow for the start of their Champions League defence. They have been pre-warned. Ancelotti has spoken of being \"careful\" in the \"complicated environment\" of Celtic Park, where he has been burned before. In 2004, Martin O'Neill's hosts faced Ancelotti's Milan in the Champions League group and battled to a goalless draw that couldn't prevent Celtic dropping out of Europe. In March 2007, it was Gordon Strachan at the Celtic helm in the rarefied realm of the last 16 and another stalemate. The only goal of the tie came in extra-time at San Siro - a peach of a solo effort from Kaka - as the Rossoneri scraped through. It proved to be their biggest scare on the way to lifting the trophy. The triptych was completed six months later as Celtic exacted revenge and propelled themselves towards the last 16 by defeating Ancelotti's European champions 2-1. You remember that game, right? A Celtic fan running on to the pitch and giving Dida a light tap, with the goalkeeper going down theatrically. Those were heady days for Celtic in Europe. And while the atmosphere on European nights - lauded from everyone to Lionel Messi and Xavi to Paolo Maldini, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney - remains goosebump-inducing, Parkhead is no longer the fortress it was. Since the famous win over Barcelona in 2012, Celtic have played nine Champions League group-stage home games and won just one, losing seven. Among them was a 3-0 defeat to Milan and a 5-0 shellacking by PSG. In Celtic's five-year absence from the Champions League groups, AEK Athens, Cluj, Ferencvaros and Midtjylland all took at least a draw from Parkhead in qualifiers. In the same period, 12 group-stage home matches in the secondary competition, the Europa League, yielded eight Celtic victories and four defeats.  Last season, Ange Postecolgou's first in charge, Celtic were thumped 4-0 at home by Bayer Leverkusen before wins over Real Betis and Ferencvaros. Bodo/Glimt then triumphed 3-1 in Glasgow in the Europa Conference knockout rounds. Still, Celtic have come a long way in short time under Postecoglou, who is targeting European improvement with a fortified squad boasting strength in depth.  The Australian has vowed not to waver from his attacking philosophy on the Champions League stage.

{"title": "Celtic 0-3 Real Madrid: Champions League holders show class in clinical showing", "content": "Celtic were ultimately outclassed by holders Real Madrid in their Champions League opener, despite a lively and encouraging start in Glasgow. Five years after they last featured at Europe's top table, Celtic gave Real a fright in a frantic first half by creating a series of chances, including a shot off a post from Callum McGregor. But after the break the visitors roused themselves, and goals from Vinicius Junior, Luka Modric and Eden Hazard showed their class and secured victory. Carlo Ancelotti's side - who lost Karim Benzema to injury in the first half - join Shakhtar Donetsk at the top of Group F after they defeated RB Leipzig. Celtic travel to Warsaw to face the Ukranian side next Wednesday in their second group game, aiming to get their campaign back on track, after their grand return against European football royalty ended in disappointment. But it was not a dispiriting night at a bouncing Celtic Park as the Scottish champions made a good impression on the biggest stage. Ange Postecoglou vowed his team would be true to their front-foot style despite Real's quality, and it was in evidence straight from kick-off as they pressed Thibaut Courtois into kicking the ball out after 12 seconds. From the throw-in, Liel Abada lashed just wide as the stadium roared its approval. It was not a flash in the pan either, with the Israeli winger set free in behind the defence after a wonderful pass from Jota, but his rushed shot went straight into Courtois' hands. And after McGregor rattled an upright from the edge of the area and half-time substitute Daizen Maeda scuffed a brilliant opportunity from six yards, there was a sense of foreboding that Celtic's missed chances would haunt them. Almost inevitably the five-time European champions Modric and Tony Kroos grew in influence and Real did punish Celtic's profligacy in a beautifully effective four minutes. A flowing move which started at the feet of Courtois ended with Vinicius planting Federico Valverde's cross in the bottom corner, before Hazard set up Modric to caress home at the second attempt. With Celtic suffering from their first-half exertions, Real controlled the ball with greater ease and put together a stunning 33-pass move which culminated in Kroos picking out Dani Carvajal, who stroked across goal for Hazard to tap home their third. Celtic kept fighting to the end and still looked a threat in flurries, but ultimately they were outclassed in the second-half by the 14-time kings of Europe, whose quality shone through. With two minutes left on the clock, and at 3-0 down, the Celtic fans were singing the name of their manager over and over. It shows how revered Postecoglou is because of the style of football he has brought, and it was on full show in the first half. The midfield trio of McGregor, Reo Hatate, and Matt O'Riley buzzed about, Giorgos Giakoumakis was relentless up front, while centre-backs Moritz Jenz and Cameron Carter-Vickers defended diligently. Had Abada showed his usual ruthless streak, things might have been different. As it was, Kroos and Modric did what Kroos and Modric do, superbly supported by precocious Frenchman Aurelien Tchouameni. Kroos completed 119 passes on his own and his sublime ball for the third goal encapsulated his ability, and Modric just glided across the Celtic Park turf, stroking in the second goal with the outside of his boot. The last time the little Croatian was in Glasgow he took Scotland apart at Euro 2020, also slamming in a beautiful goal. He obviously loves playing here, and was a joy to watch once more even as he turns 37. Celtic were chasing shadows slightly by the end, but they can take encouragement their style can cause problems against the best, with RB Leipzig and Shakhtar Donetsk to come. : \"Obviously disappointed with the outcome. I thought the first goal was always going to be important and up until that point we were well in the game.  \"If anything, we had the better chances and you need to capitalise on them - and we didn't.\" \"\"It was like two games, first half we suffered a bit with intensity, second half we had control.  \"We were not surprised [with Celtic's start]. We knew they could start really fast. We were lucky because they hit the post. Second half, was much better. When we opened to scoring it was easier for us to control the ball.\" Celtic are at home to Livingston on Saturday in the Scottish Premiership (15:00 BST), before facing Shakhtar in Warsaw on Wednesday (17:45). Madrid have Mallorca at the weekend before hosting Leipzig. Formation    4-2-3-1 Formation    4-3-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62771360"},
{"title": "Dinamo Zagreb 1-0 Chelsea: Thomas Tuchel says 'everything is missing' after Champions League loss", "content": "674 Thomas Tuchel took charge of Chelsea for the 100th time on Tuesday, but there was no celebration after the game. In fact, after a disjointed showing in their  shock 1-0 Champions League loss  against Dinamo Zagreb, the pressure seems to be mounting on the German and his side. Tuchel did not mince his words after Chelsea suffered their third defeat in seven games in all competitions this season. \"We are clearly not there, where we need to be and where we can be,\" he said. \"So it's on me, it's on us, we need to find solutions.\" Tuchel added on BT Sport: \"At the moment, everything is missing, [there is] too much to analyse. I'm a part of it. \"I am angry at myself, I am angry at our performance. I didn't see it coming. \"We need to be much better. We are not finished, we are not happy but I thought we were on a good way. I am surprised by this performance.\" Roman Abramovich was seen as the man who changed English football by buying Chelsea in 2003 and then sanctioning an incredible period of spending in the transfer market. In his 19 years as owner, the Blues won 20 pieces of silverware, including five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues. But the Russian was  forced to sell the club  because of his links with President Vladimir Putin and  new owner Todd Boehly  has followed suit by allowing Tuchel to splash the cash. Their outlay of almost £300m in the summer transfer window was the highest in Europe, but it seems the big-name signings are so far struggling to gel. Centre-backs Kalidou Koulibaly and Wesley Fofana, who together cost more than £100m, are yet to forge a cohesive partnership in defence, while debutant Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will need time to settle in after having his jaw broken in a violent robbery at his house. England international Raheem Sterling was largely anonymous against Dinamo and £60m Spanish left-back Marc Cucurella was introduced off the bench to little effect. Chelsea have now failed to keep a clean sheet in their past six games, since opening the Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory at Everton. Mislav Orsic, who netted a hat-trick to knock Tottenham out of the Europa League in the 2020-21 season, scored the winning goal for Dinamo in the 13th minute with a beautifully dinked finish. \"It's an underperformance from us,\" said a furious Tuchel. \"We have the same story as always. \"We have an OK start, we don't finish our half-chances, we don't feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes. \"Then we concede one counter-attack, which is far too easy, and from there we struggled.\" Asked how many players were at the top of their game, Tuchel replied: \"Not a lot at the moment. \"I don't know where this performance comes from. It's a lack of hunger, intensity, a lack of determination to win duels, to actually do things on the highest level. \"You cannot expect to win games, not in the Premier League or Champions League. We are not where we want to be.\" Tuchel's frustrations boiled over once again as he was booked by the referee in Croatia for complaining about time-wasting by the opponent. It's not the first time this season the German has been in trouble with the officials, having had a heated confrontation with Tottenham boss Antonio Conte after their  2-2 draw  last month. Both men were shown a red card for their actions, but Tuchel was handed a  one-game touchline suspension  as well as a fine. He led Chelsea to their second Champions League title just four months after his appointment in January 2021 - and the Super Cup and Club World Cup quickly followed, but last season ended trophyless. Now after an inconsistent start to the season, Tuchel needs to quickly address his side's issues. \"Where do we start?\" asked former Chelsea forward Joe Cole on BT Sport. \"Balance, I think that's the key. The new guys at the back have really got to pull it together as soon as they can. There's no flow. \"We could have picked countless incidents where Koulibaly was on the wrong side. For a 31-year-old defender, he really needs to get up to speed. \"At the other end of the pitch, is there a lack of confidence starting to develop? There's a lot of talk of lack of goals, lack of assists. \"The front three, he made four or five changes in that area, and they all look low on confidence. They are all quality players at Chelsea, but for some reason it's just not happening for the likes of Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech etc.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62815129"},

The Scottish Premiership runners-up and Scottish Cup winners will be in Belgium for the first leg on 2 or 3 August, with the return at Ibrox on 9 August. The draw for the play-off round will be on 1 August, with those ties taking place over 16-17 and 23-24 August. Beaten on penalties in last season's Europa League final, the Ibrox side were seeded for the draw.

Union SG topped their domestic standings after the first round of 34 matches last season but finished second behind Club Bruges following the six-match play-off series.

{"title": "Dinamo Zagreb 1-0 Chelsea: Mislav Orsic scores winner in Group E opener", "content": "994 Two-time winners Chelsea began their Champions League campaign with a shock defeat at Dinamo Zagreb.  The Croatian champions have a woeful record in this competition - winning just five of 43 games before this meeting - but they stubbornly held on after taking a first-half lead. The dangerous Mislav Orsic netted the 13th-minute winner, running through from the halfway line and beautifully dinking a finish past the advancing Kepa Arrizabalaga. Dinamo came agonisingly close to a second but Stefan Ristovski's thunderous, long-range effort was superbly tipped on to the bar by Arrizabalaga. Deadline-day signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was handed his Chelsea debut and, although the ex-Arsenal skipper had a goal ruled out for offside, he largely looked off the pace. Armando Broja replaced Aubameyang just before the hour mark, but the Albanian had little impact in an overall disjointed performance from Thomas Tuchel's men. Chelsea launched a late onslaught on Dinamo's goal and the hosts were relieved to see Reece James' low shot rattle the foot of the post with five minutes remaining. In Group E's other game, Serie A champions AC Milan drew 1-1 against Austrian champions FC Salzburg. In the first transfer window under their new owners, Chelsea were Europe's highest spending club with an outlay close to £300m on new signings this summer. The Blues, though, look an incoherent outfit and although Tuchel - who took charge of the side for the 100th time against Dinamo - is not yet under pressure, the German will quickly need to work out his side's problems with hands-on new owner Todd Boehly watching closely. A solid defensive platform was the bedrock of Tuchel's success in his first few months at the club, when he led them to their second Champions League title with victory over Manchester City. But in seven games in all competitions this term, the Londoners have already lost three times and kept just one clean sheet, which came on the opening day of the Premier League campaign against Everton. Former Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly is an experienced Champions League player, but defensive team-mate Wesley Fofana was making his first appearance in the competition. And the lack of understanding between the pair - who cost more than £100m between them - in the early days of their partnership was apparent for the goal when they both went for a high ball, yet neither got to it. It allowed Bruno Petkovic to flick the ball on for Orsic, who held off Fofana before advancing on goal and converting with the coolest of finishes. Arrizabalaga, who started instead of out-of-form number one Edouard Mendy, did not have much to do, but denied Ristovski with a stunning save. At the other end of the pitch, Aubameyang was given a first start since signing from Barcelona and the 33-year-old striker played in a face mask, having been involved in a violent robbery at his home which left him with a broken jaw. The signs were good when he ran through early on, but failed to pick out a team-mate with his cutback and struggled to make an impact thereafter. Chelsea's general showing was one of slow build-up play which did not do enough to unlock a well-organised and obdurate Dinamo backline. The visitors chased an equaliser with time running out, but Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic saved Mason Mount's first-time strike and Kai Havertz's header from six yards out was brilliantly blocked by Robert Ljubicic. It was just Chelsea's second group stage loss in 18 games, while Dinamo held on for a famous victory. The perfect start from the Croatians gives them hope of reaching the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time, having failed to do so in all previous seven appearances in the competition.

{"title": "Kenny Miller column: 'Rangers can turn Champions League qualifier around'", "content": "The important thing at this stage of the season is to just win games.  Against Union Saint-Gilloise, Rangers didn't do that, so there needs to be a reaction on Tuesday night. It's been three games for Rangers now that have been pretty similar in the respect that teams are defending against them and, in the Livingston and Union games, their opponents were actually getting a goal start and could then defend a lead.  Against Kilmarnock on Saturday, it took a while to break them down but they got there in the end. Rangers are trying to incorporate new players into the team. It does take a bit of time. You're looking at five new players that could be in the starting line-up any given week. It's going to take a bit of time for these lads to get used to the club, get used to their team-mates. Domestically, the positive thing is it's six points out of six. I would fully expect the performances to get a lot better - I think they need to get a lot better. There's been a lot of talk about Antonio Colak not having too much involvement. It's always a weight off your shoulders when you get your opening goal for a new club as a striker - Saturday's performance from Colak was better.  He was more involved in Saturday's game than he was in the previous two and that's important for him. You need to feel involved. He rounded it off with a good goal. Your team-mates need to know where your strengths lie as well and these connections will get stronger as games pass. What Rangers need is Alfredo Morelos and Colak competing with each other, pushing each other on. Last season, Rangers were going into big cup finals and semi-finals where they did not have a recognised striker. It's important that these two lads are at the top of their game and competing for that slot. Based on the European run last season all the way to the Europa League final, you saw the impact the crowd have when Rangers start fast and aggressive. The longest it went at one of the home games I think was 15 minutes and then the goal came. In the other games, it was three or four minutes. That energises the crowd. It gets Rangers on the front foot and has a negative effect on the opposition. It really spooks them and puts them under a little bit of pressure that maybe they've not been used to. Everybody wants to start fast and start well but, for Rangers, they are at their best when they are on the front foot, when they are aggressive, when they are getting in the opposition's face, making them turn the ball over, getting the ball back and then playing quickly and attacking their goal. I wouldn't expect anything else than a real solid defensive unit from Union. They have a two-goal lead to protect and Rangers are going to have to work for it. With the greatest of respect to Union, Rangers were 1-0 down against Sporting Braga, 1-0 down against RB Leipzig - a Champions League team - and overturned it. There's no reason why they can't get it back. Within that Leipzig game, it should have been 3-0 within 25 minutes and game over. Union are a good team but they're not Leipzig's level. If Rangers can get their level of performance to what they are capable of then, absolutely, they can turn it around.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62458125"},

{"title": "Champions League third round qualifying: Union Saint-Gilloise 2-0 Rangers", "content": "Rangers' Champions League hopes are in the balance after they slipped to a meek defeat by Union Saint-Gilloise. The visitors' positive start evaporated when Teddy Teuma was allowed too much space in the box to fire the opener. Then, after a VAR check deemed Connor Goldson had handled in the box, Dante Vanzeir rolled in a second-half penalty to double the Belgian side's lead. It leaves Rangers with it all to do in the second leg of the third qualifying round tie at Ibrox next Tuesday. Their deficit could have been higher had it not been for a vital block from goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin to deny Vanzeir when he was through one-on-one, while James Tavernier cleared a header off the line in added time. Antonio Colak had passed up a glorious chance to equalise at 1-0, but Rangers were a shadow of the side that reached the Europa League final last season. The winner of the tie will face Monaco or PSV Eindhoven for a place in the group stage, with those sides drawing 1-1 in the first leg in France. Rangers had settled quickly and tested Anthony Moris twice in the early stages through a Borna Barisic free-kick and long-range drive from James Sands. However, that was the sum total of the home goalkeeper's work in the opening period. Union began to find their rhythm and poise midway through the half, and gave Rangers fair warning of what was to come when Simon Adingra drove down the left and put the ball on a plate for Vanzeir only for Sands to pop up with a crucial intervention. That warning was not heeded, however, as Teuma smashed the ball under McLaughlin via a slight deflection a minute later after Barisic had knocked the ball into his path. It could have been two before the break, but Tavernier intervened to deny Adingra a tap-in. Glimpses of the Union goal were infrequent for Rangers, though Colak could have been forgiven for expecting a team-mate to get on the end of the ball he smashed across the six-yard box. Shortly afterwards came the penalty award and although Rangers felt the VAR-assisted award was harsh, Vanzeir was unperturbed as he rolled it past McLaughlin. Fortunately for Rangers, McLaughlin was able to get something on the forward's breakaway effort a few minutes later or the tie could be all but over. Giovanni van Bronckhorst has shown a willingness to adapt his tactics, particularly away from home in Europe, and that flexibility has largely served him and Rangers well. Playing Sands and John Lundstram either side of Connor Goldson mirrored Union's own defensive set-up and appeared to be designed to allow Rangers to build play from the back, and freeing Barisic and Tavernier a little further up the park. However, the home side employed an extra man in the middle of the park, outnumbering Glen Kamara and Ryan Jack. That told, as Union used their stranglehold of the engine room to help dominate play, choking Rangers' attacking ambition. Rangers are at home in the Scottish Premiership to Kilmarnock on Saturday (15:00 BST), before welcoming Union Saint-Gilloise to Ibrox in the second leg of this tie on Tuesday (19:45).

The Colombia striker has not travelled to the Netherlands for Wednesday's Champions League play-off decider, with the tie level at 2-2. He was sent off in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Hibernian. \"He has to show me he wants to play for Rangers,\" Van Bronckhorst said of the 26-year-old. \"I know he wants to play, but to play for Rangers, you need to have a certain level mentally, physically - and, at the moment, he's not ready to play. \"As a person, it was a hard decision. As a manager, it was an easy one because we are here to represent our club and to get into the Champions League tomorrow evening and that in my eyes was best, to take the squad we brought tonight.\" Asked about Morelos' future at the club, Van Bronckhorst commented: \"We wait and see what happens.  \"The biggest factor in that is Alfredo himself. So we have to see how the coming days, weeks go.\" The striker, who has scored 113 goals in 228 Rangers appearance, has yet to start a game this season after recovering from injury and was red-carded 13 minutes after coming off the bench in Saturday's Scottish Premiership match. Rangers  successfully appealed against  a red card shown earlier to midfielder John Lundstram but did not challenge the one for Morelos in Edinburgh. Van Bronckhorst's decision, taken after consultation with senior players, was backed by centre-half Connor Goldson, who said Morelos \"obviously done something stupid on Saturday, he did let us down\". \"I just think a fit and firing Alfredo is one of our most important players and obviously, until he gets back to that, I don't think he is helping us as much as he can do,\" Goldson added. \"He has had a massive injury, probably the first big injury that he has had in his career, and it has taken some time to come back from that, so we need him to be as fit and ready as much as possible because he is one of the best players in this team.\" On his Instagram account, Morelos posted a cryptic message in Spanish on an image that translated to: \"The best warrior is not the one who always triumphs but the one who returns without fear to battle.

{"title": "Champions League: Real Madrid bucked trend to conquer Europe", "content": "571 Before May's Champions League final, Carlo Ancelotti was asked what he thought of Liverpool. \"They have a lot of quality together, with high intensity and good organisation,\" the Real Madrid manager said. \"Jurgen Klopp has brought some new things to football. He's doing a great job.\" What he said after Real's rope-a-dope 1-0 win revealed more though, suggesting that while Klopp's side may be great at what they do, they are not able to do much else. \"Liverpool were easier to decipher than others,\" Ancelotti told Sky Sport Italia. \"They have a very clear identity and we could prepare the way that we did. We knew what strategy to take.\" Uefa's technical report of the tournament -  an exhaustive analysis covering 125 matches,  with observations from 23 experts including England manager Gareth Southgate - has illustrated how Real bucked tactical trends to take the prize. Defend high, press hard, squeeze space and seize the day; for Klopp and others steering most of Europe's superpowers, the philosophy has been clear for some time. Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all kept a stratospherically high defensive line in their Champions League campaigns. During the knockout stages, their last defender was an average of 45.5m, 44.4m and 43.6m respectively up the pitch when out of possession.  Those were the three highest totals in the tournament. By contrast, Real Madrid sat back. They recorded 35.2m for the same statistic, the 10th highest among the last-16 teams. With Ancelotti prioritising precision on the ball rather than pressure off it, Real's rivals moved easily up the pitch. Uefa measured the inroads the opposition made from each spell of possession. Only Sheriff Tiraspol and Dynamo Kyiv gave up more territory than Real. Only Chelsea, Ajax and Atalanta offered up less than Liverpool. Fabio Capello, one of Uefa's experts and a former Real manager himself, saw it as a pragmatic choice based on personnel. Real's midfield trio of 30-year-old Casemiro (now at Manchester United), Toni Kroos, 32, and Luka Modric, 36, are long on years as well as trophies and technique. \"The midfielders are not young, not so fast,\" Capello observed. Whenever Real were unable to keep the opposition at an arm's length, they needed the long reach of their goalkeeper to bail them out. Thibaut Courtois duly did, emerging as the dominant figure in the final. The former Chelsea goalkeeper,  peeved by a perceived lack of appreciation  for his ability in England, made nine saves to deny Liverpool. It was the most by a goalkeeper in a Champions League final on record. Courtois also made more saves than any other goalkeeper in the competition, with 59. Most tellingly, he topped the standings for goals prevented. The statistic, essentially the opposite of xG (expected goals), measures how a goalkeeper performed against the shots they faced. Overall, against par, Courtois prevented 4.63 goals across Real's run.  At the other end of the pitch, Real also performed better than the average. Legendary France striker Karim Benzema, backed by Brazilian duo Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior, was ruthless. On the spreadsheet, Real Madrid's xG after the group stage was 21.78. However, on the pitch they managed to hit the net 29 times. Those goals often came at the end of patient, probing periods of possession, rather than the warp-speed attacks of their high-pressing rivals or the more direct back-to-front style of the competition's underdogs. Real Madrid had the ball for an average of 16.2 seconds before each goal, more than any other team that reached the knockout stages. Again, Liverpool provided a contrast. Klopp's break-neck side had the ball for an average of 9.5 seconds before finding the net. Some elements to Real's success were harder to measure. With 15 minutes to go of their last-16 tie against Paris St-Germain, they were heading out. With 10 minutes to go of their quarter-final against Chelsea, they were heading out. With five minutes of added time left against Manchester City, they were heading out. Each time, they slipped out of the stranglehold and into the next round. Outrageous good fortune? Outstanding mental fortitude? A bit of both? Maybe that's why Ancelotti kept his summary simple after the final. \"Vinicius scored a goal, Courtois made saves, end of story!\" he said.  How Real got there was far from simple though.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62659271"},
{"title": "Rangers 2-2 PSV Eindhoven: All square after breathless play-off first leg", "content": "Rangers' hopes of ending their 12-year absence from the Champions League group stage are on a knife-edge after an enthralling draw with PSV Eindhoven. The Ibrox side fell behind to Ibrahim Sangare's thumping finish, only to hit back swiftly with Antonio Colak's well-crafted equaliser. Goalkeeper Walter Benitez's howler, spilling a Tom Lawrence free-kick, gifted the hosts a second-half lead. But they were denied a comeback win by Armando Obispo's 78th-minute header. Slick PSV then almost snatched victory in a breathless contest, with Jon McLaughlin making a sprawling save from Philipp Max. The sides meet again in the play-off second leg next Wednesday in Eindhoven to decide who progresses to the lucrative group stage. Rangers had fed off the intensity of a febrile Ibrox to burn past Union St-Gilloise in the previous round, overcoming a two-goal first-leg deficit for the first time in their history, but talent-laden PSV were a serious step up in quality. They had Rangers on the ropes for much of the second half as Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side struggled to match the electric home performances of last season's run to the Europa League final. It's the Champions League top table where Rangers now long to be and they travel to the Netherlands with their dream very much intact having posed PSV's vulnerable defence problems. Ruud van Nistelrooy - a long-time friend and former Netherlands team-mate of Van Bronckhorst - has begun his managerial career with his PSV team delivering a glut of goals this season. They wasted little time in showing their threat as Luku de Jong slipped between static defenders to clip a lovely delivery from Ismael Saibari narrowly over. The offside flag had been raised, yet the warning was clear. Malik Tillman, deployed just off lone striker Colak, tried to get Rangers going, sending a drive skidding straight at Benitez then jinking towards the six-yard box before a heavy touch spoiled his build-up work. Rangers were screaming for a penalty moments later but their appeals yielded nothing further than a VAR check after Connor Goldson's header hit the outstretched upper arm of Jordan Teze. PSV continued to look a menace on the counter-attack and after Rangers survived a let-off at a corner, with Tillman slicing an attempted clearance into McLaughlin's arms, the Dutch made their next one count. The impressive Cody Gakpo's delivery wasn't dealt with by Rangers and when Teze got a toe to the loose ball to tee up Sangare, the midfielder applied a thumping finish.  Rangers' response was rapid and emphatic. Steven Davis' splendid pass sprung James Tavernier down the right and the full-back's cutback was expertly swept first time into the far corner by Colak for the striker's fourth goal in four games.  The goal galvanised Rangers and Tavernier sent a header into Benitez's arms then Colak had a near-post effort parried away by Benitez. The momentum was soon punctured, though, as PSV began to assert dominance. Ibrox held its collective breath when a simple move cut the hosts open. De Jong's flick-on from a long ball was seized upon by Saibari, whose poked shot ruffled the side-netting on its way past. Saibari was in the thick of things, rifling a shot too high before darting into the box and forcing a low stop from McLaughlin. Rangers were hanging in there, and their grit was rewarded with a goal out of nowhere. There looked little danger when Lawrence's free-kick from 30 yards out bobbled towards Benitez, only for the keeper to inexplicably let the ball wriggle out of his grasp and trickle over the line. PSV did not let the howler prey on their minds, and struck back when Obispo rose to meet a corner and divert his header in off the bar. Van Bronckhorst will be concerned that Rangers twice - avoidably - conceded from corners. PSV possess plenty of height, but their opener was a scruffy affair stemming from a routine delivery that should have been dealt with, while Obispo was afforded too much space for the second. Rangers must provide sterner resistance next week. The hosts also found themselves stretched in midfield at times, with Gakpo and Saibari offering pace and width and PSV not afraid to go direct. Yet while only operating at their peak in bursts, van Bronckhorst's men showed resolve to secure a draw and trouble a defence that has conceded in all six games this season. Colak continues to grow in stature as the Ibrox side's striking figurehead, with the Croatia international having netted for the fourth game running. His link-up play and finishing prowess will be crucial in the decider. Tillman and Lawrence also offered glimpses of inspiration and Rangers will head to Eindhoven confident they can create the chances to progress to the Champions League promised land where a £30m-plus windfall awaits.  \"We gave everything. At moments we played really well against a quality side. The differences in 90 minutes weren't that big. \"Happy with the performance, we could have had a better result but also worse. So everything to play for next week.\"  \"First half Rangers were the better team, we struggled. The fans were behind them and we had to go through a difficult phase. \"The better of the chances were for us in the second half and 2-2 is a fair result.\" Rangers have a Scottish Premiership trip to face Hibernian on Saturday (12:30 BST) before their Champions League fate will be decided in the second leg with PSV next Wednesday (20:00).

{"title": "Champions League draw: What awaits Celtic & Rangers in group stage?", "content": "It's been a long five years without a Scottish representative in the Champions League group stage. And an even longer, 15-year wait, since two took part in the same season. But that interlude is now over, Rangers beating PSV Eindhoven to join city rivals Celtic among the continent's elite. With the draw on Thursday, let's explain how it works and look ahead at what is potentially ahead for both Glasgow clubs. Spoiler alert: A lot of teams that are very good at football lie in wait... You know how these things usually go… a lot of talking, a lot of random awards given out, and a host of legendary ex-players on stage awkwardly trying to crack open small plastic balls. Thursday's draw in Istanbul - where this season's final will be played - will most likely be no different. What we know for certain, though, is 32 teams will feature.  Of those, 26 were given direct entry to the group stage, which of course included Celtic. A further six came through the play-off qualifiers, with Benfica, Maccabi Haifa, Viktoria Plzen, FC Copenhagen and Dinamo Zagreb all joining Rangers. The teams are split into four seeding pots - more on that below - with a club from each making up eight groups of four. Celtic and Rangers will both be in Pot 4. So no European Old Firm derbies… yet. Clear enough? Magic. Let's get to the juicy stuff… It's no big deal, honestly. It's just made up of the Champions League winners Real Madrid, the English, Italian, German, French, Portuguese and Dutch champions. Oh aye, and Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt. Celtic captain Callum McGregor said last week how the fans of the Parkhead club would most perhaps most favour being drawn with the reigning champions Real. The Spanish giants would certainly provide two stern tests for either Old Firm side, but also two glamour occasions, as would Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Manchester City. On paper, Ajax, Eintracht and Porto - a club Rangers took four points off in the 2019-20 Europa League - would perhaps be the more favourable options, but that takes nothing away from the calibre of each side.  You know what, this lot might be even more daunting. Even if Celtic and Rangers can manage to get one of the 'weaker' top tier teams, they could still be landed with a Liverpool, Chelsea, Barcelona or Juventus.  And even if they miss those, one of Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, RB Leipzig and Tottenham would be coming to Glasgow. No easy games, and all that. So, this is getting to be a bit of a theme now. Another pot, another rash of right good sides. How about Borussia Dortmund? Benfica? Inter Milan? Bayer Leverkusen? Not fancy any of those? Well what about Napoli, Sporting CP, RB Salzburg or Shakhtar Donetsk? Some might prove less vexing than others and, bear in mind, both Celtic and Rangers have decent recent records themselves. But regardless, when the balls are plucked from the bowls and the wee bits of paper unfurled, excitement is guaranteed.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62650394"},
{"title": "Champions League draw: Busy group stages, strikers on the move and Ukrainian teams", "content": "The Champions League draw takes place at 17:00 BST on Thursday in Istanbul - so what do you need to know? The group stage will be played over nine midweeks this season so the World Cup can be accommodated. So who is in it, who is going to win it, how does it work and how has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected things? The Champions League takes the same format as always. Four English teams - Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham - went straight into the group stage along with Scottish champions Celtic, while Rangers booked their place by beating PSV Eindhoven in a qualifier. One team from each pot goes into each group, but teams from the same country cannot be drawn together. Real Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Manchester City, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain, Porto, Ajax. Liverpool, Chelsea, Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Leipzig, Tottenham. Borussia Dortmund, Salzburg, Shakhtar Donetsk, Inter Milan, Napoli, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Bayer Leverkusen. Rangers, Marseille, Copenhagen, Club Bruges, Celtic, Viktoria Plzen, Maccabi Haifa, Dinamo Zagreb. Uefa has to fit the Champions League group stage into a smaller period of time because of the Qatar World Cup. The group stage starts on 6 September and runs to 2 November - a period of nine weeks (compared to 12 weeks normally).  Usually it runs until the second week of December - but the World Cup kicks off on 20 November. There will only be three weeks without Champions League games between the groups starting and ending. Two of those land during the September international break - and the other in mid-October has a full round of midweek Premier League games. The knockout stages will be later than usual. The last-16 ties will be played over a month from 14 February to 15 March. The quarter-finals are in April and the semis in May. The final is at Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium on 10 June 2023. It was initially meant to be the venue for the 2020 final, and then the 2021 showpiece, but both finals were moved to Portugal because of Covid restrictions. Several of the Champions League's top goalscorers of recent years have been on the move this summer. Robert Lewandowski, the third top scorer in the tournament's history with 86, has moved from Bayern Munich to Barcelona. Sadio Mane, who netted 10 Champions League goals in 2017-18, has in effect replaced him after making the move from Liverpool. Darwin Nunez, who scored six goals last season, has in turn moved from Benfica to replace Mane at Anfield. Erling Haaland, who won the Champions League golden boot in 2020-21, has joined Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund. He has scored 23 goals in only 19 games in the tournament. Sebastien Haller, last season's third top scorer with 11 goals for Ajax, took Haaland's place at Dortmund - though he is having chemotherapy for a testicular tumour and will be out for a few months. Meanwhile, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is in the top 10 Champions League scorers ever, is back in the tournament for the first time since 2017 with AC Milan. Despite a widely held view that the Premier League is the top league in the world, only two of the previous 10 Champions Leagues have been won by English teams.  On both occasions they were all-English finals, with Liverpool beating Tottenham in 2019 and Chelsea defeating Manchester City in 2021. Liverpool have lost two of the past five finals to Real Madrid, including last season at the Stade de France. Manchester City will hope the addition of Haaland, who averages a Champions League goal every 64 minutes, will get them over the line this season. Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are hoping for a fourth final in six years, while Chelsea are bidding to become only the third English team (after Liverpool and Manchester United) to win three European Cups. Tottenham, finalists in 2019, were guided back into the Champions League last season by Antonio Conte and will hope that the Italian - winner of one Premier League and four Serie A titles as a manager - can lead them to silverware. There will be no Russian teams in this season's Champions League as part of the Uefa punishment because of the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk will play their group games at Legia Warsaw's Stadion Wojska Polskiego in Poland, almost 1,000 miles from Donetsk. That will be Shakhtar's fourth different Champions League home ground away from their city since Donetsk was captured by pro-Russian separatists in 2014. Dynamo Kyiv, who lost to Benfica in the play-offs, also played their qualifiers in Poland, at the LKS Municipal Stadium in Lodz.

{"title": "Champions League: How calm Giovanni van Bronckhorst ended Rangers' 12-year wait", "content": "Giovanni van Bronckhorst's unflappable demeanour finally dissolved at full-time in Eindhoven, as the Rangers manager erupted in joy and bounced in ecstatic unison with his backroom team. It was an outpouring of emotion after the Dutchman had calmly and adroitly negotiated every obstacle thrown his way on a night of Champions League high drama. From his bold decision to exile striker Alfredo Morelos from the squad, to a barrage of PSV chances as Van Bronckhorst's underdogs weathered a storm then landed a killer blow. Even the journey to the Philips Stadion turned into farce as hordes of PSV fans blocked the Rangers team bus and caused them to arrive 20 minutes late. The Scottish side's request to Uefa to have kick-off delayed was rejected, but they blanked out the chaos and delivered a composed and unflinching performance in their manager's image.  It allowed Van Bronckhorst to be \"more relaxed than last week because of the way we played\". Antonio Colak - the striker keeping Morelos out of the team - scored for the fifth time in six matches to settle a tight tie 3-2 on aggregate and propel Rangers back to the group stage for the first time in 12 years. The significance resonated with Van Bronckhorst as Rangers completed their recovery from financial implosion and life in Scotland's bottom tier in 2012.  \"It is a very proud moment,\" he said. \"I know what it means for the fans, for the club, to be playing in the highest level in Europe, competing with the best teams. \"We're here to compete. We want to compete with the best teams in Europe. It will be difficult but it's an experience I will love. \"It comes close to being the best moment [of my career] because of where Rangers have come from. Ten years ago we were at our lowest point and it has taken a lot of work, energy and time from a lot of people to build the club back to this level.\" Having stunned some of the continent's best on the run to last season's Europa League final, Van Bronckhorst's side have scaled a memorable new high. They have done it the hard way, too, overhauling a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Union St-Gilloise in the previous round before edging past a PSV side heavily fancied after last week's 2-2 Ibrox draw. Not least because Rangers' previous 11 away trips in Europe had yielded just one win. The build-up to their Eindhoven mission was tainted by the Morelos controversy, with the Colombia international left out for attitude and fitness reasons. It was a decision that could have backfired on Van Bronckhorst, but his instead further enhanced his reputation, says former Rangers team-mate Neil McCann. \"Van Bronckhorst as a manager is like a mirror image of the guy I played alongside,\" McCann told Sportsound. \"Very considered, quiet, calm, very rarely got flustered. \"He wasn't soft, could stick his foot in - and he has stuck his foot in with the brave decision to leave Morelos at home. Van Bronckhorst has earned brilliant stripes to take this side into the Champions League.\" Fellow former Ibrox forward Steven Thompson added: \"It's just a phenomenal result. It means so much to the club, to the players, to Van Bronckhorst. \"He has won this competition as a player [with Barcelona] and now to take Rangers into the group stage as manager is incredibly special for him. It's sensational evening for him and for Rangers.\" What now for Morelos? As Rangers players crowd round the TV on Thursday to discover their group-stage opponents, will the Colombian be warmly welcomed? His future remains in doubt, with less than a year to run on his contract, but Van Bronckhorst refused to wash his hands of the player. \"Morelos qualified for the Champions League as well,\" he said. \"I think he is also proud to see his team-mates and club qualify for the biggest competition in the world. \"He is still a Rangers player and I will push him the way I can to get him fit and get the Morelos back we all want.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62665634"},
{"title": "PSV 0-1 Rangers (2-3): Antonio Colak fires side into Champions League for first time since 2010", "content": "Rangers will play at European football's top table for the first time in more than a decade after stunning PSV Eindhoven to reach the Champions League group stage. The decisive moment of an absorbing tie finally came on the hour, when Malik Tillman intercepted a PSV pass out from defence and squared for Antonio Colak to find an empty net from six yards. The Philips Stadion went almost silent and the home side could find no response in the final half hour despite a flurry of chances. Rangers can now look forward to drawing some of the continent's biggest names in Thursday's draw, where they join rivals Celtic in pot four as the pair play in the group stage in the same season for the first time since 2007/08. Also vital will be the minimum £25m windfall which will now come their way as the Ibrox side complete the turnaround from playing in Scotland's third division 10 years ago to the Champions League. The feat was achieved with a huge amount of resilience as PSV threatened throughout, and also amid the controversy surrounding striker Alfredo Morelos, who was left at home due to concerns about his attitude and fitness. Instead it was the man who has started in his stead all season, Colak, who was in the right place at the crucial moment to score his fifth goal in eight games after brilliant awareness from Tillman to read and shut down goalkeeper Walter Benitez's pass. The inevitable response from PSV came as Philip Max shot wide, and goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin denied their star man Cody Gakpo when through on goal, and those were just the opportunities which came after Rangers struck. There were others, including a free header from Ibrahim Sangare and a shot from close-range from Luuk De Jong fired straight at McLaughlin, but ultimately there was no way through. Rangers showed immense character to hang on and also had their own strong spells, with Tom Lawrence unlucky not to score with a fantastic curling effort which cannoned back off the bar.  But it was their European muscle memory which got Giovanni van Bronckhorst's team over the line, as they again proved a smart, skilful and gutsy team on the big stage, traits which characterised their run to last season's Europa League final.  Now, the club and its fans can look forward to testing themselves on the biggest stage. Rangers have impressed regularly in Europe in the past four seasons, and this performance underlines the belief and confidence in the group as they triumphed despite trying circumstances. Van Bronckhorst made a huge call to leave out Morelos and travel with just one recognised striker in Colak, and their preparations were disrupted further before kick-of when their bus was held up by PSV fans. Then there was the fact their away record in Europe read just one win in 11.  But away from Ibrox and in a rowdy arena, they still produced the goods. It wasn't the swashbuckling football they showed on their run to Seville last season, but they were disciplined, rode their luck, and delivered big moments when it mattered. Tillman's reading of the game was crucial, and McLaughlin's brilliant save from Gakpo kept them ahead. With Celtic already assured of their place in the group stage, it was vitally important for the club financially to keep pace and qualify. The manager has to take huge credit for his influence on the team, having now guided them to six wins from six in two-legged European knockout ties. His calm authority and tactical nous have stood out particularly in cup competitions. Almost exactly 10 years ago Rangers were held to a draw by Berwick Rangers in the third division, this caps the journey back. The league title two seasons ago was crucial, but now they can truly say they have returned to the top level. Ross County are the visitors to Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST), but before that they can enjoy Thursday's group stage draw, which takes place at 17:00.

{"title": "Champions League: Liverpool fans invited to report crimes at Stade de France", "content": "Fans who fell victim to crime at last month's Champions League final have been invited to file complaints by French authorities. Supporters of both Liverpool and Real Madrid said they were attacked by gangs as they left the Stade de France in Paris following the match. There were also reports of fans being robbed or assaulted before the game, which the Spanish champions won 1-0. Fans can fill in a complaint form via the French Embassy in London. A  statement  on the embassy's website says \"foreign nationals who were victims of crime during the Champions League Final on 28 and 29 May 2022 can file a complaint to the French judicial authorities\". \"These temporary arrangements reflect the French Government's wish to give foreign nationals the opportunity to get in direct contact with the French judicial authorities regarding crimes of which they believe they were victims during the event,\" it adds. The announcement comes a day after MPs condemned the experience of Liverpool supporters at the event as  \"terrifying\" and \"chaotic\". The matter was raised by Liverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne, who was at the final. As well as the attacks on fans, those at the game described heavy-handed policing, organisational chaos and overcrowding. European football's governing body, Uefa, has commissioned an independent review into the problems suffered by fans following complaints from both clubs involved in the final. The final itself was delayed by more than half an hour, with Uefa initially blaming the late arrival of fans. Uefa, police and French ministers also said fans with fake or no tickets were to blame for the pre-match chaos. Uefa has apologised to the fans of both clubs, though many, including Byrne, want a full retraction of what they say were \"smears\". However it is the post-match trouble which has sparked debate in France, with one police union head  describing how they \"had never seen anything like it\". \"They were attacking women, children, old people, and then merging back into the crowd when the police came,\" Patrice Ribeiro of Synergie-officiers told Le Figaro newspaper. A Real Madrid statement last week also spoke of their supporters being \"attacked, harassed, set upon, mugged. Some even had to spend the night in hospital because of their injuries.\" Former Liverpool defender and now TV pundit Jim Beglin was among those caught up in the scenes, describing it as \"the scariest I've ever experienced\". \"Organised gangs set about mugging departing fans. We ran a gauntlet of thuggery on our way to the Metro. Not a police officer in sight. Witnessed so many ambush attacks on unsuspecting attendees. Reprehensible.\" he said. Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram also  told how he had his phone stolen  by pickpockets near the stadium \"like many others\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61726404"},
{"title": "Rangers 3-0 Union Saint-Gilloise (agg 3-2): Scots stun Belgian visitors to make play-offs", "content": "Rangers roared into the Champions League play-offs after they overcame Union Saint-Gilloise and a two-goal first-leg defeat in a rousing showing. The hosts had it all to do after losing in Belgium, but goals from James Tavernier, Antonio Colak and Malik Tillman gave Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side a spirited victory at Ibrox.  While blunt in the first leg, Rangers were by far the better team in Glasgow against a Union side who had Lazare Amani sent off late on. Tavernier's penalty and Colak's close-range header set up a tense finale, before Tillman's fantastic 79th-minute header put Rangers ahead in the tie for the very first time during a strong second half. They will now face PSV Eindhoven in the play-offs as they bid to return to the group stage for the first time since 2010. It is the first time Rangers have ever overcome a 2-0 first-leg deficit to progress in Europe. The hosts started well, as they did in Belgium seven days ago. The Ibrox atmosphere, which Rangers have come to rely upon on such nights, seemed to have shaken the opposition. That is no slight on Union - many bigger European teams have also wilted under that pressure. Colak headed just over early on before he had another effort tipped above the bar by Anthony Moris. Set-pieces were Rangers' strength in the first half, but they were unable to unlock a stubborn Union defence in open play. That was until Siebe van der Heyden stretched an arm to block a looping cross in the box, and Tavernier did what Tavernier does - slotting from the spot on the stroke of half-time. His 16th goal in European competition for Rangers, and one that was timed to perfection. The second just before the hour brought Ibrox to its feet in a scene of hysteria. Getting on the end of a Tillman flick, Tavernier ghosted in behind to square. The ball fell to Scott Arfield who forced a fantastic save from Moris, but Colak showed predatory instincts to nod in from a yard out and level the tie. From there, it felt inevitable that Rangers would find a third. John Lundstram went close when Tom Lawrence teed him up, but Moris produced a flying save to deny the midfielder. There was a moment of doubt when James Sands appeared to be heading down the tunnel early after clearing a poor pass from John McLaughlin - but referee Tasos Sidiropoulos changed his mind after consulting the far side assistant. That was the kick Rangers needed and soon they would be ahead. Borna Barisic's hanging cross looked destined for Moris' arms, but Tillman produced an acrobatic leap to steal in front of the keeper and nod into an empty net. Union midfielder Amani was then sent off in the dying seconds as the game raged frantically, with Rangers advancing after a breathtaking two legs. Even trailing by two goals, plenty of Rangers fans headed to Ibrox confident of a result. They had witnessed enough European evening evidence in the last year to calm their nerves. Proved right, there were still moments throughout the night that would have tested their resolve. Union, as they did in the first leg, waited to pounce but their attacking potency had almost evaporated. So instead of a disaster, this will be remembered as a scare. But PSV, their next opponents, will not be as forgiving. However, with Ibrox able to rouse such spirited performances from this Rangers team, the club's supporters will be dreaming of another memorable season in Europe.  \"I'm really pleased we're still in contention to go to the group stage. I think we made this tie very difficult because of the first performance and we needed a huge performance today. \"We know what went wrong last Tuesday but we need two games like we delivered today to have a chance to go through [against PSV].\" \"We kept a clean sheet and just created as many chances as possible. This game needed a big performance and the players gave a big performance\" Rangers host St Johnstone on Saturday (15:00 BST) as they look to maintain their 100% record in the league so far.

Brobbel's low shot found the bottom corner to give the Welsh champions a 1-0 victory. Matthew Clarke went close for David Healy's Linfield in a hard-fought contest at Saints' Park Hall home. The Northern Irish side must look to turn the tie around in the second leg at Windsor Park on Wednesday, 13 July. Saints, who were playing their first Champions League tie in three years, were the better side in the first half, with Brobbel firing wide from the edge of the area before he saw a free-kick saved by Linfield keeper Chris Johns. Clarke's header was cleared off the line by Danny Davies as Linfield threatened before the break. Declan McManus shot over just after half-time before turning provider when he picked out Brobbel in the penalty area and the former Northern Ireland Under-21 international cut onto his right foot before beating Johns.  McManus fired over as TNS threatened to double their lead, but Linfield - who claimed a friendly win over World Cup hosts Qatar last month - pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages. Jordan Stewart shot straight at Saints keeper Connor Roberts, who then did well to deny Stephen Fallon. \"I think it is a big night for the club. We had a big crowd, a lot of opposition fans as well. That's good for the club and to get the win, we'll take it. \"I thought our players executed the game-plan very, very well. They grew into the game.

{"title": "Champions League qualifier: Linfield fight back to secure dramatic extra-time win over TNS", "content": "Jamie Mulgrew hit a stunning long-range goal as Linfield secured a dramatic extra-time win over The New Saints to move through to the Champions League second qualifying round.  Substitute Ethan Devine scored the crucial second goal early in extra-time to give them a 2-0 win at Windsor Park and a 2-1 aggregate victory. The visitors were on the verge of progressing thanks to their 1-0 first-leg win when Linfield captain Mulgrew, on as a sub, found the top corner from 25 yards to force extra time.     Irish Premiership champions Linfield will now play FK Bodo/Glimt of Norway in the second qualifying round, after the Norwegians defeated KI Klaksvík.  Welsh champions TNS, meanwhile, drop into the Europa Conference League qualifying second round and will play Iceland's Vikingur. To add further to the drama on Wednesday night in Belfast, experienced skipper Mulgrew was a late addition to the Linfield bench not long before kick-off. The 34-year-old produced a moment of real quality and one of the club's best-ever European goals when he controlled the ball well from 25 yards out and hammered an unstoppable right-foot shot that flew straight into the top corner.  The aggregate winning goal then came four minutes into extra time, courtesy of fine work from full-back Matthew Clarke, who started the night as captain, and sub striker Chris McKee. Clarke made an excellent tackle deep in his own half before progressing with the ball and playing it into the channel, with McKee sprinting at full speed to keep it in and deliver a low left-wing cross which youngster Devine slid in to stab home from close range.    The former Cliftonville and Knockbreda striker, signed by Healy in January, came close to equalising two minutes before Mulgrew's leveller but his header from a lovely Kirk Millar cross came back off the crossbar. The Blues had goalkeeper Chris Johns to thank for keeping the second-leg score at 0-0 when, nine minutes after the interval, he made a superb save from a Declan McManus downward header, with Clarke later making a fine block to deny the TNS forward. One worrying moment for Linfield came in the closing stages of extra time when Joel Cooper went off with what looked like a hamstring injury. He was one of their best players on the night, particularly during their bright start to the game. He beat two men and delivered a cross early on that just evaded Daniel Finlayson, before Chris Shields fired off target from long range after being teed up by Stephen Fallon. Full-back Finlayson had the best opportunity of the half on 19 minutes when he met an inviting Fallon cross from the left, but his header under pressure was superbly saved by Connor Roberts down low to his left. The pace of the game began to drop after the opening half hour and visiting keeper Roberts was booked for time-wasting from a goal-kick before Millar fired well wide for the hosts.  Danny Davies had the only effort of note for the Welsh champions, who won the first leg through a Ryan Brobbel goal, six minutes from the interval when he chopped inside well before firing too close to Chris Johns. At the other end three minutes later, Robbie McDaid stooped to meet a delicious Shields cross with a diving header that had power but was saved by Roberts to ensure the sides went in level at the break.

The draw for the third qualifying round, featuring Dundee United, and the Champions League third qualifying round, featuring Rangers, take place on Monday. BBC Scotland rounds up the draws and dates affecting Scottish clubs. Motherwell, who finished fifth in the Scottish Premiership last season, are unseeded for the third-round draw which takes place at 13:00 BST on Monday. Should they see off Sligo, the Steelmen will face a seeded opponent from one of the following four ties:  Jack Ross' Dundee United are also unseeded and will meet the winner of one of these four ties: The third qualifying round will be played over 4 and 11 August. The play-off round draw will take place on 1 August and those matches will be on 18 and 25 August. Motherwell reached the Europa League third qualifying round in 2020-21, losing 3-0 to Israeli side Hapoel Beer Sheva in a one-off tie, while United, fourth in the Premiership last term, are returning to the European arena for the first time in 10 years. Europa League finalists and Scottish Cup winners Rangers sealed a Champions League qualifying berth by finishing as Premiership runners-up. Rangers' recent impressive European form means they are seeded in the third qualifying round, with the draw being held at 11:00 BST on Monday. Also seeded are Benfica and PSV Eindhoven and Rangers will meet either Ligue 1 side Monaco, Austria's Sturm Graz, Belgium's Royale Union Saint-Gilloise or the winner of Midtjylland's second qualifying round tie with AEK Larnaca.

{"title": "Champions League final: Great moments from past Liverpool and Real Madrid meetings", "content": "The 2021-22 Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid is the latest instalment in a rivalry that has produced some of the most memorable moments in the competition's long history. These two European heavyweights locked horns for the first time in the 1980-81 European Cup final and have met on seven occasions since, treating supporters the world over to fabulous goals, virtuoso solo performances and the odd sprinkling of controversy. BBC Sport takes a look back at some of the most unforgettable moments this fixture has seen. The teams' latest meeting takes place almost 41 years to the day after the sides first did battle in another Paris showpiece. In 1981, a scrappy, tactical encounter appeared to be heading for extra time until Liverpool's Alan Kennedy ran onto a throw-in from his namesake Ray, darted into the Real Madrid penalty area and found the far corner to seal the Reds' third European Cup success in five seasons. Just weeks earlier, the left-back's hopes of featuring in the final - if Liverpool made it - appeared in tatters after he broke his wrist in the semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich. \"The doctor said it was a 10-week job,\" said Kennedy, who travelled to Paris the following month still unsure whether he would be playing. \"[Manager] Bob Paisley told us the team when we got to the ground. It was a shock to be included, but once the manager gives you the go-ahead you tune yourself in and get ready to go.\" Real's first visit to Anfield, in the 2008-09 Champions League last-16 second leg, is still regarded as one of the finest European nights Liverpool's famous old stadium has ever witnessed - thanks largely to a breathtaking individual display from Fernando Torres. The former Atletico Madrid striker had sustained an ankle injury in the Reds' 1-0 first-leg victory at the Bernabeu but returned with a vengeance to spearhead a Liverpool performance that underlined their European credentials under then-manager Rafael Benitez. The only mystery was how Torres didn't score more. The Spanish frontman put Liverpool ahead after 16 minutes and could easily have had a hat-trick, with the excellent Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas twice denying his compatriot and preventing Benitez's team from winning by an even greater margin. Captain Steven Gerrard scored twice on his 100th European appearance for the club, before Andrea Dossena sealed their comfortable passage to the quarter-finals - where they were beaten 7-5 on aggregate by Chelsea. It was a very different story five years later. In a reversal of fortunes from the 2009 victory, it was Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool side who faced an exercise in damage limitation during the 2014-15 group stage as the visitors threatened to run riot with three goals in 18 first-half minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo's wonderful opener broke the deadlock before Karim Benzema's double completed a dominant win that left the Anfield club with just three points from their opening three games. They would miss out on a place in the knockout stage, finishing third in Group B behind Madrid and Swiss outfit Basel. Controversial striker Mario Balotelli, who had joined Liverpool for £16m that summer, incurred the wrath of manager Rodgers when he was spotted swapping shirts with Real defender Pepe at half-time. \"It is not something I stand for,\" Rodgers said afterwards. \"If you want to do that, do it at the end of the game. It is something we will deal with.\" Balotelli was sent on loan to AC Milan at the end of the season. Spearheaded by the fearsome trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, Liverpool arrived in Kyiv for the 2018 final on the crest of a wave.  Egypt international Salah in particular had defied all expectations following his summer move from Roma, scoring an astonishing 44 goals in all competitions - including 10 in the Reds' remarkable run to their first Champions League final in 11 years. Jurgen Klopp's team started confidently against a Real side wary of Liverpool's attacking triumvirate, but the balance of power shifted midway through the first half when Salah sustained a shoulder injury in a challenge with Madrid captain Sergio Ramos.  The departure of their talisman, who left the pitch in tears, temporarily silenced the travelling Reds fans and lifted the La Liga side, who would go on to claim a third successive Champions League title in dramatic fashion. At the half-time interval, Salah's premature departure looked like proving the main talking point of the 2018 showpiece, but there was plenty more to come in Kyiv. In a second-half packed with incident, a calamitous error from Loris Karius gifted Benzema an opener six minutes after the restart before Mane's close-range finish restored parity. Nine minutes later, Gareth Bale stepped off the bench to score one of the great goals in the competition's history.  The Wales international had only been on the pitch for two minutes and two seconds when he sent an unstoppable overhead kick past Karius - a strike the former Tottenham and Southampton player would later describe as his \"best ever\". Ex-England international defender Rio Ferdinand also declared it \"illegal\" during BT Sport's live coverage of the game. There was also time for Karius to fumble a long-range Bale effort into his own net to compound Liverpool's misery and earn Zinedine Zidane his third Champions League triumph in as many years. But the night belonged to Real's Welsh wizard.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61366790"},

Real's 1-0 victory, secured by Vinicius Junior's 59th-minute winner, wrote coach Carlo Ancelotti's name into the history books indelibly with his record fourth triumph as a coach in this tournament.  For Liverpool, it capped six days of desperate disappointment after missing out on the Premier League to Manchester City by a single point then losing to this experienced, street-smart Real team.   This final, however, will not simply be remembered for Liverpool's defeat and Real's victory.  It will also be remembered for the scenes outside Stade de France in the hours leading to kick-off, when a road leading out of an underpass adjacent to the stadium became dangerously overcrowded with Liverpool supporters.  As you walked alongside those fans, you could feel temperatures and frustrations growing by the minute with large crowds making no progress. It was an unpleasant, uncomfortable experience.  As tension rose, even larger queues formed at entrances to the stadium, ending with French police using pepper spray and tear gas on supporters and the kick-off being delayed by 36 minutes as the Liverpool end of this vast bowl remained sparsely populated.  Liverpool have demanded a formal investigation into the events while Uefa claimed turnstiles \"became blocked by thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work\".  This was the desperate backdrop to a game in which Liverpool created so many opportunities but ran into one of the great goalkeeping performances from Thibaut Courtois.  As Liverpool's players slumped to the turf, with Trent Alexander-Arnold standing motionless for several minutes, manager Jurgen Klopp and his players will reflect on an outstanding campaign that brought two trophies but also ended in undoubted anti-climax.  Alexander-Arnold looked particularly downcast, not just at the pain of defeat but also the fact that Vinicius arrived in yards of space behind him to score what proved to be Real's winner. And there is a remarkable statistic which bears examination, especially when it is attached to a team renowned for its attacking prowess.  Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup, both on penalties, against Chelsea. The blank scoresheet here means that in three finals they have not scored a goal in open play, including two periods of extra time.  Given they have the attacking quality of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota, it is always a surprise when they do not hit the back of the net. It did not cost them in the EFL Cup and FA Cup but it did here.  And the man responsible was Courtois, who was as close to perfection as it is possible to be, making six saves from Salah alone plus a quite brilliant effort to turn Mane's shot on to the post.  This was meant to be Salah's redemption night after he fell victim to a Sergio Ramos foul and went off injured after only 30 minutes of the 2018 final when Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in Kyiv.  He made his intentions clear with his \"we have a score to settle\" tweet moments after Real Madrid's astonishing comeback in the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu confirmed this latest meeting.  Salah will ask himself forever how he did not score at least one goal here. He might have nightmares featuring the face of Courtois, such was the one-man barricade he formed.  Liverpool have looked a little jaded from their exertions in recent weeks and there was an air of desperation about their attempts to restore equality in the closing minutes in the face of the experience and game management of opponents who are time-served masters of the Champions League art.  Klopp and his players have given everything and will show off the EFL Cup and the FA Cup on their parade of Liverpool on Sunday, but how they would have loved to make it a seventh win in this competition.  No-one in their right mind would paint Liverpool's season as a disappointment overall, given the silverware they have claimed and the relentlessly thrilling chase of Manchester City that looked, at one point on the season's final day, that it might bring the title until Pep Guardiola's side scored three goals in five minutes against Aston Villa.  And but for Courtois' heroics that giant trophy might well have been making its way back to Merseyside.  Instead, it was the smiling Ancelotti who held it aloft in front of adoring Real Madrid fans so used to this experience. He will enjoy the familiar feeling of a Champions League celebration on his return to Spain. Real have sailed close to the wind in the Champions League this season, most notably when they needed two goals to survive against Manchester City in the semi-final with 90 minutes gone.  They found a route and any team that can reel off Paris St-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool as those they have defeated fully deserve to win the Champions League. No-one can question it.  For Liverpool, this cannot be called a disappointing season - they have been truly outstanding - but there is no escaping the fact it reached a disappointing conclusion on two major fronts in an unsavoury environment in Paris.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61619749"},
{"title": "Real Madrid: European champions 'have done remarkable things'", "content": "Real Madrid's latest European triumph has been built on drama and incredible comebacks - and has been achieved eight months after they were on the wrong end of one of the great Champions League shocks. Last September, the Spanish giants were conducting an inquest after losing at home to  Moldova's Sheriff Tiraspol  in the group stage. On Saturday, Real were crowned champions of Europe for a record 14th time - twice as many as any other club - after defeating Liverpool 1-0 in Paris. At the full-time whistle, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti celebrated with his players on the pitch as they took in the scale of their achievement. \"They were probably not even the better team so many times in the Champions League this season,\" French football expert Julien Laurens told BBC Radio 5 Live. Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport: \"These guys have done remarkable things.  \"Real Madrid were not expected to do this, but with every hurdle, they have overcome it with grit and determination.\" Real lost four times in 12 Champions League matches on their way to the final. By comparison, defeat at the Stade de France was Liverpool's fourth in 63 matches across all competitions in 2021-22. Yet Carlo Ancelotti's side finish the campaign kings of Europe after an extraordinary campaign. Trailing 2-0 to Paris St-Germain on aggregate in the last 16, Real  scored three times  in the space of 17 second-half minutes to go through. They also trailed holders Chelsea 4-3 on aggregate in the closing stages of their quarter-final before Rodrygo scored in the 80th minute to force extra-time. They advanced  5-4 on aggregate  thanks to Karim Benzema's 96th-minute goal. And then they produced the  comeback of all comebacks  in their semi-final against Manchester City. Real trailed Pep Guardiola's side 5-3 on aggregate with just one minute of normal time remaining in the second leg - but then Brazilian substitute Rodrygo scored twice to force extra time. Benzema, who has scored seven Champions League goals against English teams this season, then sent Ancelotti's side to Paris with a penalty. Even against Liverpool in the final, Real had to weather a strong start by Jurgen Klopp's side - and won despite only managing two attempts on target. \"In my time, I've never seen a harder route to the final,\" added Ferdinand. \"They've beaten PSG, they beat the champions of England. It's breathtaking.\" Former Real Madrid and Liverpool winger Steve McManaman added: \"Madrid do what they always do. When they get to finals, they win them. It has been the greatest of successes for them because of the manner and style.  \"This Madrid team is weaker but they have got to the final and lifted it.\" Although he did not score in the final, Benzema has been the heartbeat of Real's latest European triumph. Ancelotti has got the best out of the 34-year-old France forward, who has struck 15 goals in Europe this season - including two hat-tricks - and is the Champions League's leading scorer in 2021-22. Will it be enough to win him the coveted Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best player? \"The argument is over for the Ballon d'Or. If Benzema doesn't get it, that will be a travesty,\" added Ferdinand. No one has won the Champions League more times as a manager than Ancelotti, who is celebrating his fourth triumph in the competition as a boss. \"I am a record man,\" said the Italian after the game. \"I think we passed through really difficult games.\" Real were hoping to parade France forward Kylian Mbappe earlier this week, but the striker opted to commit his future to Paris St-Germain. His decision to stay in Paris did not go down well. The Madrid press  were apoplectic,  to the point that in the early part of the week all coverage was about the non-deal rather than the small matter of the Champions League final. However, Real put all that behind them to overcome the Reds and spark jubilant scenes in Spain's capital. \"This is an incredible generation. They have won it five times in eight years, the biggest competition at club level, the toughest one to win,\" added Laurens.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61621738"},
{"title": "Karim Benzema: Should Real Madrid striker win Ballon d'Or?", "content": "579 Karim Benzema seems to be the overwhelming favourite to win the Ballon d'Or after Real Madrid's Champions League victory - so is this the French veteran's finest hour? The 34-year-old, who scored 44 goals in 46 games this season, would become the second-oldest player to win it after Blackpool's Stanley Matthews, who was 41 when he won the first ever award in 1956. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was man of the match in Paris and Vinicius Jr scored the only goal in the  1-0 win over Liverpool.  It was a rare quiet night for Benzema - who had a goal disallowed for offside - in a brilliant season. \"Of course,\" Benzema told Canal Plus if he was thinking about the Ballon d'Or - the prize organised by France Football which is awarded annually to the world's best footballer. \"Now I will join up with the national team but I don't think I can do much more with my club. We will see what happens, but in any case I am proud of what I have done.\" He added: \"Let's see what happens. I have trophies and I have nothing else [to prove] on the pitch. The important thing is to enjoy it.\" France legend Thierry Henry, speaking on American television, said: \"I just want to say something to France Football or whoever is watching - close the votes. Benzema won it. Bye.\" So how good has Benzema been, who usually wins the Ballon d'Or and what would this mean? There is one quite simple argument for Benzema to win the 2022 Ballon d'Or on 17 October - he has been the star player for the best team in Europe. Real Madrid won La Liga and the Champions League - and Benzema won the Golden Boot in both. He scored 27 league goals, nine clear of anyone else, and 15 Champions League goals - one every 74 minutes. Benzema was a clutch player too, with 10 of those 15 goals coming in the knockout stages alone - a joint record in a season. He netted a hat-trick at home against Paris St-Germain and another at Chelsea in the next round - plus the winner against Manchester City in the semis. \"The argument is over for the Ballon d'Or,\" said former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport. \"If Benzema doesn't get it, that will be a travesty.\" Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti said: \"We are dependent on Benzema. Karim is a modern forward and [does] what is required of strikers - everything, including defensive work.  \"He is the perfect representation of what a centre-forward should be in today's football.\" Benzema's two top-scorer trophies this season were his first since the 2007-08 Ligue 1 Golden Boot, when he scored 20 goals for champions Lyon as a 20-year-old. He has experienced a huge career revival since Cristiano Ronaldo's departure from Real in 2018. Benzema's role in that team was largely to help Ronaldo score, but he has come into his own since Ronaldo left for Juventus, becoming the star forward himself. In Ronaldo's final two seasons at Real, Benzema scored 11 and five La Liga goals respectively. In the following four years he has averaged 23 league goals a season, on Saturday won his fifth Champions League, and after a six-year exile from the France team he returned last year to score nine goals in 13 games for Les Bleus. However, it has all come amid the backdrop of a scandal which stunned the football community in France. In November 2021,  Benzema was found guilty  of conspiring to blackmail former France team-mate Mathieu Valbuena with a sex tape. A judge gave Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a fine of 75,000 euros (£63,000). Before Saturday's game people speculated the winner of the Champions League final could decide the winner of the Ballon d'Or. Liverpool's Sadio Mane won the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal - and Mohamed Salah won a third Premier League Golden Boot. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was asked before the match if the winner of the final could scoop the individual trophy. \"When you think about how these type of competitions are decided the answer is probably yes,\" he said. \"You are either Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or you won the Champions League final. That is the way it goes. That's how it was in the last few years. It will increase the chances definitely.\" Klopp is not wrong. You have to go back to 2006 and World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro for the last time the Ballon d'Or was awarded to someone other than Messi, Ronaldo or a Champions League winner. Admittedly Kaka in 2007, and Luka Modric in 2018, were the only players apart from the big two to win in that time.  It was widely believed Robert Lewandowski,  who won the 2019-20 treble with Bayern Munich, would have won in 2020 but the award was cancelled because of Covid. Benzema has been nominated several times - and will certainly be on the shortlist announced on 12 August - but he has never finished in the top three. He would become the first Frenchman since Zinedine Zidane - Benzema's former manager at Real Madrid - in 1998 to win. BBC Sport went to Benzema's hometown of Bron in Lyon before the game to talk to some of his childhood friends. Farouk said Benzema, whose parents are both Algerian, gives \"hope for the youth\" for people who share his background. \"Now everyone thinks they can make it as footballer, or at least make their dreams come true,\" he said. \"In Bron we support Real Madrid 100%, we watch all the matches. When Real Madrid are playing everyone is watching. \"When he can come to Lyon or Bron he'll visit and play a five-a-side with us older guys, and when the kids see him, he'll stop and speak to them. \"I would say that he has inspired many in Terraillon [a neighbourhood in Bron]. \"We're proud of him. We have one dream here - and that is that he wins the Ballon d'Or and we wish him all the best in the world.\" If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please  click here to vote.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61624319"},
{"title": "Champions League final: Liverpool call for investigation into 'unacceptable issues' faced by fans", "content": "Liverpool have called for an investigation into the \"unacceptable issues\" faced by fans which led to their Champions League final against Real Madrid being delayed. Uefa delayed kick-off by more than 30 minutes, citing \"security reasons\". The match at the Stade de France in Paris did not start until 20:36 BST,  with Real beating Liverpool 1-0 . Police outside the ground fired tear gas as a small number of supporters tried to climb over security barriers. UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston tweeted: \"We are very concerned about the upsetting scenes around the Stade de France last night and shall be working with the appropriate authorities to find out what happened and why.\" Liverpool defender Andy Robertson  said  the organisation of the match was a \"shambles\". Merseyside Police said its officers who were deployed in Paris and attended the match \"reported the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner, arriving at turnstiles early and queuing as directed\". \"Our officers returning today will conduct a formal debrief to ensure that we can fully support any subsequent investigation following last night's game,\" said assistant Chief Constable Chris Green. Merseyside Police's matchday officers tweeted that it was \"the worst European match I've ever worked or experienced\". They added: \"I thought the behaviour of the fans at the turnstiles was exemplary in shocking circumstances. You were not late 100%.\" Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson criticised the \"appalling management and brutal treatment of fans\" and said she would be writing to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss \"requesting answers from Uefa and for [France's] President Emmanuel Macron to investigate\". Liverpool fans' group Spirit of Shankly said the situation was \"totally shambolic and extremely dangerous.\" Pictures had emerged in the build-up of huge crowds of fans queuing to get in. Many claimed they had been at the stadium hours before kick-off but were stopped from getting into the ground. \"We are hugely disappointed at the stadium entry issues and breakdown of the security perimeter that Liverpool fans faced this evening at Stade de France,\"  the Anfield club said  in a statement. \"This is the greatest match in European football and supporters should not have to experience the scenes we have witnessed tonight. \"We have officially requested a formal investigation into the causes of these unacceptable issues.\" On Sunday, Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan said the club wanted supporters to come forward with their experiences to feed into any investigations. \"We want to provide those facts to the relevant authorities,\" he said. \"In the coming days, we will be setting up a mechanism for supporters to reach out to us directly to provide their experiences and accounts of what happened.\" European football's governing body Uefa said it was \"sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the French police and authorities, and with the French Football Federation\".  \"In the lead-up to the game, the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles,\" it explained. \"This created a build-up of fans trying to get in. As a result, the kick-off was delayed by 35 minutes to allow as many fans as possible with genuine tickets to gain access. \"As numbers outside the stadium continued to build up after kick-off, the police dispersed them with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium.\" French police had urged fans not to force entry with  tweets 20 minutes before the game  was scheduled to begin. As kick-off approached, large areas of empty seats could still be seen inside the ground. Outside, some fans were seen climbing perimeter fences or attempting to run past security. Riot police were also in attendance. Liverpool players emerged to warm up again at 20:06, with messages on the big screens inside the stadium stating the delay was because of the late arrival of fans.  French police said fans with fake tickets had tried to force access to the stadium but \"the rapid intervention of the police allowed the return to calm\". They added they were able to disperse fans \"without difficulty\". They also said there were no major incidents at fan zones in the city, although 500 people were moved on from a bar near the Liverpool fanzone at Cours de Vincennes. French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera tweeted: \"The attempts at intrusion and fraud by thousands of English supporters complicated the work of the stadium staff and police but will not tarnish this victory.\" While interior minister Gerald Darmanin also blamed British fans. BBC journalist Nick Parrott, who was outside the ground in a personal capacity, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I have just been pepper sprayed for the first time in my life. I have been to the Champions League final before and I have never been pepper sprayed before. \"I was outside Gate Y which has been opening and closing repeatedly over the last hour and a half but nobody has been going through. The security staff on the other side advanced and sprayed pepper spray.\" The opening ceremony started at just after 20:20 BST before the game finally got under way 16 minutes later. Some 10 minutes after kick-off, Football Supporters Europe said \"thousands are still trapped outside the stadium, remaining calm in the face of a completely unreasonable situation\".  The body added: \"Fans at the Champions League final bear no responsibility for tonight's fiasco.\" BBC Sport's John Watson, at the ground, said he had \"passed hundreds of Liverpool fans queuing at entry gates an hour before kick-off and not being permitted entry\". \"I'm at a loss to understand the reasoning for the delay being the late arrival of fans,\" he added. Defender Robertson says he had given a ticket to a friend but he was denied entry for the game. \"One of my mates got told it was a fake which I assure you it wasn't,\" he said. \"It was horrendous for our fans and all families that have been through it as well. It wasn't a nice experience, not a nice final to come to. The Champions League should be a celebration but it wasn't that.\" Liverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne  tweeted  to say he had \"endured one of the worst experiences in my life\", blaming Uefa for \"horrendous security and organisation putting lives at risk\". \"I pray no fans have been injured because of the disgraceful lack of organisation and expertise,\" he added. Dominic King, from the Daily Mail, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had been speaking to supporters queueing to get into the stadium.  \"It came from nowhere,\" he said. \"There has been no violence or antagonism. They are just dismayed by how the authorities have treated them.\" \"We got told about 45 minutes before, that our end was filled while there were thousands outside,\" Liverpool fan Tyler, who spent £1,000 on his ticket, told BBC Radio 5 Live. Fans also said they were assaulted and robbed by local gangs when leaving the stadium following the match. Former Liverpool defender and now television pundit Jim Beglin was among them and  tweeted:  \"Post-match last night was the scariest I've ever experienced. \"Organised gangs set about mugging departing fans. We ran a gauntlet of thuggery on our way to the Metro. Not a police officer in sight. Witnessed so many ambush attacks on unsuspecting attendees. Reprehensible.\" The final was originally to be played in St Petersburg, but the city was stripped of the game following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61619831"},
{"title": "Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid: Reds beaten in Paris as Vinicius Jr hits winner", "content": "12111 Liverpool's bid to claim the Champions League trophy for the seventh time ended in bitter disappointment as Vinicius Jr's second-half winner gave Real Madrid victory in Paris.   Jurgen Klopp's side ran into a one-man wall of defiance as Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois produced one of the great individual performances to thwart Liverpool time and again.  Mohamed Salah, seeking revenge for his early departure through injury in the 2018 final against Real, was denied six times by Courtois who was simply unbeatable. The victory also sees Carlo Ancelotti make history by becoming the first coach to win a fourth Champions League title. Real were always a threat and the decisive moment came after 59 minutes when Vinicius stole in unmarked at the far post to score.  This was also a final marred by chaotic scenes outside Stade de France with thousands of Liverpool fans, some targeted with pepper spray by French police, unable to get into the stadium, forcing the kick-off to be delayed by more than 30 minutes.  Liverpool's magnificent season brought them the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup - both won on penalties against Chelsea - but ended in a double disappointment in the final week of a stellar campaign. The Champions League might have eased the agony of just missing out on the Premier League to Manchester City by one point, only for Liverpool to find themselves on the wrong end of a goalkeeping masterclass from Courtois.  The Belgian was simply perfect as he was a constant thorn in Salah's side, turned Sadio Mane's shot on to the post brilliantly and commanded his penalty area with faultless handling.  Salah held his head in disbelief on many occasions as Courtois manned the barricade for Real, leaving the Egyptian to nurse the pain of another Champions League final defeat by the Spanish giants.  Liverpool were not quite at their best and eventually paid the price for not taking chances as Real pounced in trademark fashion to win this tournament for a record-extending 14th time.  Klopp's side could not have given any more as they pushed to the final whistle but looked jaded towards the end - no surprise given the demands made of them this season.  Liverpool will still take huge credit by maintaining a push for an historic quadruple until the final week of the season but the conclusion will sting.  The occasion left even more of a sour taste given the events outside Stade de France. Liverpool are demanding a full investigation into how thousands of their fans could not get into the stadium, with dangerous numbers packed into small areas as kick-off approached.  Real Madrid have been living by the skin of their teeth in the Champions League this season, but any side that beats Paris St- Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool to reach their goal answers every question.  This is a side that knows how to get the job done, no matter how late they leave it, no matter how much the odds seem stacked against them.  Real are bolstered by years of experience and quality that gives them concrete-clad self-belief that has seen them navigate their way out of so many tight situations.  And what a moment for their legendary coach Ancelotti, who was brought back to the Bernabeu from Everton a year ago and has won La Liga and the Champions League on his return.  Ancelotti can now lay claim to history with that fourth triumph, once again showing his mastery of managing egos and high-class players who respond to the vastly experienced Italian's promptings.  He was the most relaxed man in Paris at his pre-match press conference, oozing confidence, and can now look back at two Champions League wins over Liverpool, here and for AC Milan in 2007, after losing in the so-called miracle of Istanbul in 2005.  Ancelotti is one of the greats and has proved it again.  Thibaut Courtois Formation    4-3-3 Formation    4-3-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61609200"},
{"title": "Champions League final: Uefa commissions independent report into scenes outside stadium", "content": "Uefa has commissioned an independent report into the scenes outside the ground that delayed Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. Kick-off at the Stade de France in Paris was delayed by over half an hour with Liverpool ticket-holders seen waiting in huge queues, and French police later using tear gas on crowds. On Monday,  French authorities complained of what they called \"industrial-scale\" ticket fraud amid a row over the game's policing. French sports minister  Amelie Oudea-Castera  said there were \"no problems\" regarding Madrid supporters and the Spanish side had controlled their travelling fans better than Liverpool, who had let their supporters \"out in the wild\". Liverpool chairman Tom Werner has since written a letter to Oudea-Castera \"demanding an apology\" for her comments. Werner wrote: \"The events that occurred in and around the Stade de France on Saturday night at the Uefa Champions League final were not only incredibly dangerous for all who attended, but raised serious questions about the organization and operation of the event. \"This should be the focus of all interested parties today rather than pursuing a blame game strategy via press conference. \"The Uefa Champions League final should be one of the finest spectacles in world sport, instead it devolved into one of the worst security collapses in recent memory.\" Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan has said the club are \"reviewing legal avenues available to us on behalf of affected supporters\". In an interview on the  Liverpool website,  Hogan said he was \"incredibly surprised\" by Oudea-Castera's remarks, calling them \"completely inappropriate\". He added: \"We just feel that everyone should be focused on getting the investigation right and less about making inflammatory comments that attempt to deflect responsibility for what happened on Saturday night.\" Uefa said a \"comprehensive review\" would examine a number of factors which include the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final, it added. Uefa said in a statement: \"Evidence will be gathered from all relevant parties and the findings of the independent report will be made public once completed. Upon receipt of the findings, Uefa will evaluate the next steps.\" The report will be independently compiled and Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues from Portugal will lead the production of the review. Uefa initially blamed the \"late arrival\" of fans for the problems, delaying kick-off by 36 minutes, with Liverpool going on to lose 1-0 to Spanish champions Real Madrid. France's interior and sports ministers acknowledged difficulties in managing crowds at the final but have been pointing blame for the chaos at fans with fake tickets and local youths trying to force their way into the stadium. However, a spokesperson for France's independent police commissioner's union (SICP), Mathieu Valet, told the BBC's Newshour that \"supporters without tickets or with fake tickets were not the main problem\". \"It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,\" he said. On Sunday,  Liverpool called for an investigation into the \"unacceptable issues\" faced by fans before the match. Many claimed they had been at the stadium hours before kick-off but were stopped from getting into the ground. UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston said he was \"very concerned about the upsetting scenes\", while Reds defender  Andy Robertson  said the organisation of the match was a \"shambles\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61636938"},
{"title": "Antonio Colak: From Rangers' European scourge to Champions League saviour", "content": "Twelve months ago, Antonio Colak was the man who ended Rangers' hopes of reaching the Champions League group stage. Then of Swedish side Malmo, the Croatia striker struck twice at Ibrox to dump Steven Gerrard's men out at the third round of qualifying. A year on, the 28-year-old became the man to lead Rangers to the group phase of Europe's premier club competition for the first time in more than a decade after netting the decisive goal in the play-off triumph over PSV Eindhoven. And, after he scored twice in Saturday's victory over Ross County, BBC Scotland examines Colak's start to life in Glasgow and looks at where his promising introduction leaves fellow striker Alfredo Morelos. Despite rocking up to Ibrox with a 2-1 lead last August, there was an expectation that Malmo would be rolled over by Gerrard's Rangers in the second leg. And, after Morelos' 18th-minute opener and Bonke Innocent's red card just before the break, it appeared that expectation would be realised. But two ruthless Colak finishes in four second-half minutes stunned Rangers, who couldn't find a way back into the tie. Then on loan from PAOK, Colak's Ibrox strikes were two of 19 goals he netted during his season-long spell with the Swedish side, an impressive run of goalscoring form that prompted Rangers to make their move. Following his transfer, for a reported £1.8m, Colak has scored seven goals in nine appearances across all competitions. It could have been eight after having a header ruled out for a marginal offside call on his debut away to Livingston. The former Rijeka man, who averages almost six touches in the opposition box per 90 Scottish Premiership minutes, has shown a clinical edge by scoring four league goals from just six shots on target. Colak is also excelling on the European stage, with three of his seven strikes coming in Rangers' Champions League qualifying campaign, including both legs of the PSV success. If he can keep up his current rate of scoring, he will be on his way to a healthy total come the end of the season, but the Croat's off-the-ball work is also endearing himself to manager Giovanni Van Bronckhorst. The Dutchman hailed the striker's work-rate across the Champions League play-off tie and former Ibrox forward Steven Thompson was also quick to heap praise on the Croat. \"Colak put in another really strong shift up front,\" Thompson said on BBC Sportsound. \"He got the goal and his all-round play - linking up and work-rate - has been excellent. \"The goal was a tap-in, but he will not score a more important goal in his career. His importance to Rangers these last few weeks, the goals he's scored, he will forever be a Rangers hero.\" Given what Morelos has produced for Rangers over his five years at the club, it would be unfair to assume Colak will be Van Bronckhorst's main man this season. However, after last weekend's red card at Hibernian, the eighth of his Rangers career, Morelos' discipline has been questioned again and the Colombia striker was dropped from the squad travelling to Eindhoven. Fitness and attitude concerns were cited as reasons for his absence, issues that appeared to be ironed out, but those problems have now resurfaced after a frustrating start to the season for the 26-year-old, who missed the end of last term after thigh surgery. Prior to the season kicking off, there was optimism about Morelos committing to a new contract, with his current deal having under a year left to run.  With just over a week remaining of the summer transfer window, though, reports suggest those talks are now on hold.  However Van Bronckhorst told BBC Scotland on Saturday: \"His attitude this week with the training sessions were good and he needs to continue that effort.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62633428"},

The Ibrox side will also face Ajax and Napoli in Group A. Arfield last encountered Liverpool while playing for Burnley in 2018. \"The one that captures the attention is Liverpool because it's closer to home and we know our following is going to be sensational,\" the midfielder said. \"The three of them are amazing cities, so we're definitely looking forward to going to them.\" Arfield, who scored in a 1-1 Premier League draw at Anfield in September 2017, has been on the winning side against Liverpool just once in six meetings, losing four of them. But he is not concerned about Rangers' prospects against last season's Premier League and Champions League runners-up. \"As always, we think we can be very competitive - it was a great draw for us with a lot of big dogs in there,\" the 33-year-old said. Arfield's thoughts were echoed by manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who makes a quick return to his homeland after Wednesday's play-off win over PSV Eindhoven.  \"We are going to play some great games against tough opponents,\" he said. \"And I am sure the home games at Ibrox will be fantastic as well. \"Playing against Liverpool for the first time is fantastic, both home and away. Of course, for me, going back to Holland again to play against Ajax, there is a lot of familiar faces in the team but also in the staff and in the boardroom.\" Van Bronckhorst famously won the Champions League as a player with Barcelona in 2006. \"I faced Napoli with Feyenoord in the Champions League a couple of years ago, also a familiar ground,\" the former Netherlands, Arsenal and Rangers midfielder added. \"It's going to be tough, but you wouldn't expect otherwise being in the Champions League.\"  Meanwhile, Van Bronckhorst will have talks with Alfredo Morelos, who was omitted from the squad for Wednesday's win Eindhoven because of concerns over his fitness and attitude. Colombia striker Morelos is suspended for Rangers' Scottish Premiership home game with Ross County on Saturday after his red card against Hibernian last weekend. \"I saw him today and will sit down with him in the next days to talk about him with the plans we have for him,\" Van Bronckhorst said. \"But he still has a future with us - he is still a Rangers player. As a manager, I want to make sure I will get him back to the levels we need and that I know he can reach.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62692134"},

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp asked  why almost half of the 75,000 tickets for the game against Real Madrid in Paris are given to sponsors and officials. Most Liverpool tickets are £125 or more and 93.5% of revenue goes to the clubs. \"For us, not much will change if all tickets are 10 euros but it will change a lot for the clubs,\" said Ceferin. \"It's the system that works, and clubs couldn't function differently.\" Liverpool will play Real Madrid at the Stade de France on 28 May. Each club  has received 19,618 tickets  while a further 12,000 were put on general sale via a ballot, which closed before the semi-final second legs were played. More than one-fifth of Liverpool's allocation will cost between £410 and £578. But Ceferin argued that the system benefits clubs financially. \"I explained the same thing to one of the coaches of the two teams a couple of days ago and I can do it here,\" said Ceferin at the Uefa congress in Vienna. \"I explained it to him a bit more and took much more time because I went through every single number. \"From the revenues from the finals, Uefa gets 6.5% and 93.5% goes to the clubs. From the other matches, 100% of the revenues goes to the clubs. \"Fans of both teams get 20,000 tickets each. Sponsors that pay 100 or more million euros sponsorship - of which 93.5% goes to the same clubs - get some tickets.

It's not Uefa. I'm not giving tickets for free to my friends or selling to my friends.\" Ceferin added that any prospect of a European Super League \"is over\", with Uefa having this week  agreed a new 'Swiss-style' format  for the Champions League from the 2024-25 season. Twelve of Europe's biggest clubs signed up for the proposed competition last April, only for the project to collapse within days following a  backlash from players and fans,  as well as governments and football's governing bodies. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus remain open to the concept, but Ceferin said: \"I don't like to call it Super League because it's everything but Super League. \"For me, this project is over once and for all, or at least for 20 years.

Real boss Carlo Ancelotti confirmed the 32-year-old and Eden Hazard are back in training ahead of the game in Paris. In what would be his last Real game, Bale could equal Cristiano Ronaldo's record of five Champions League wins. \"Hazard is training well, he can play in the final, Bale can play too, everyone is motivated,\" said Ancelotti. A back problem has kept Bale out of Real's end-of-season run-in but, after playing only 20 minutes for the Spanish champions since Wales last played in March, a chance to appear on Europe's biggest club stage beckons. If so, that will end Bale's playing days for Real Madrid as his contract expires at the end of this season. He will wait until Wales have played their World Cup play-off final on 5 June  before making a decision on his future. Bale is expected to receive numerous offers to continue at club level with his hometown team Cardiff City an option in some people's eyes,  including Wales boss Robert Page. He has been linked with a return to Tottenham as well as a move to Major League Soccer in the United States, while rumours persist he may consider retiring if Wales fail to qualify for the finals in Qatar. But whatever the future holds for Bale, Real assistant coach Davide Ancelotti - son of Carlo - insists the Welshman's place in the club's history is secure. \"Gareth is a guy that is loved around the place, from the coaching staff to his team-mates,\" he said. \"This season he has struggled with injuries but we are happy to have him available for the final. \"He already gave a lot of trophies to Real Madrid and has a chance to give the club another one. \"He has written the history of the club because, if you see the pictures of the trophies in the big moments of Real Madrid, there is Gareth and, of course, he will be remembered there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61564820"},

Boss Antonio Conte has previously asked for his squad to be strengthened. \"Additional capital from ENIC will enable further investment in the club at an important time,\" said Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. The money can be spent on transfers and player wages if needed. A Tottenham statement said the \"investment represents permanent capital, with no ongoing interest cost to the club\" and provides the club \"with greater financial flexibility and the ability to further invest on and off the pitch\". Spurs' near 63,000-capacity Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was completed in 2019 and the club have also made improvements in the training centre and player accommodation.  Jonathan Turner, the club's independent non-executive director, added: \"We're pleased to welcome this investment which demonstrates the unequivocal support and commitment of our majority shareholder, ENIC. \"It is a timely injection of funds to ensure we can continue to grow the club we all love and underlines the board's continued ambitions for success.\" Coming less than 48 hours after Tottenham secured a return to the Champions League after a three-year absence, this is major news, which should be greeted enthusiastically by manager Antonio Conte. Despite a top-four finish, Conte is known to be uncertain about a number of his players and has been demanding significant investment. This move allows exactly that. It is not certain the entire £150m will be ploughed into his squad - either through transfer fees or wages - but the potential exists for it to happen, with sources underlining Tottenham's ambition for sporting success to go alongside their magnificent new stadium and state-of-the-art training ground.

{"title": "Champions League: Liverpool fan group criticises Uefa over wheelchair spaces at final", "content": "Uefa's allocation for wheelchair users at the Champions League final \"is bordering on exclusion and discrimination\", says the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association (LDSA). Liverpool will play Real Madrid in Saturday's game at the Stade de France,  which has 550 wheelchair user spaces.  Uefa says it has provided 93 wheelchair positions for the match, with each team getting 38. \"We're really angry about it,\" said Ted Morris, secretary of the LDSA. Level Playing Field - a campaign group for disabled sports fans -  has written to Uefa to ask about the issue. The final is to be played in Paris  after St Petersburg in Russia was stripped of the match  following the nation's invasion of Ukraine. \"For an event of this size, Uefa would usually aim to identify a higher number of [wheelchair] positions, but due to operational constraints (e.g. security, poor view, etc.) and the short preparation time, it was not possible to implement optimal solutions for more wheelchair positions,\" said European football's governing body.  Morris said he will be going to the game with a \"tinge of sadness\" because of the situation. \"It's not fair when bays are available. It is just wrong,\" he said. \"I'd like Uefa to clarify what they are being used for. This affects both teams.\"  Liverpool are believed to have contacted Uefa three weeks ago to request more tickets for disabled supporters but were told there were no more available.  The club are also waiting on Uefa to get back to them after asking this week if there are any returns or if more become available. Morris added: \"Liverpool have done everything in their power to help with this.\" Michael Corness' 10-year-old son Harry is a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan and missed out on a ticket to the final. \"Based on the law of averages, you are assuming that you are going to get a decent allocation of wheelchair spaces,\" Michael Corness told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I pre-booked the flights, hoping that we would be successful as Harry met the criteria of the ballot allocation based on the Champions League group games. \"I was absolutely shocked and so disheartened because I knew that based on the 38 spaces, it was going to be such a long shot to be successful. \"I was still hopeful as we did have a chance but at the back of my mind I knew it was going to be such a long shot.\" Overall, Liverpool and Real Madrid have each received 19,618 tickets for the game, which has a capacity of 75,000.

Forward Mohamed Salah, who went off injured in that match after a tussle with Sergio Ramos, has said Liverpool have a \"score to settle\". \"This was a harsh night for us - it was tough to take,\" said Klopp.  \"But I don't believe in revenge or think revenge is a fantastic idea,\" he added. \"I understand what Mo said - he wants to put it right. But in Germany we say you always meet twice in life. \"If we get the chance to win it this time it will be a great story, but it will not be because of what happened in 2018.\" Salah's comments came after Real Madrid dramatically beat Manchester City in the semi-finals. On Wednesday he said he was \"motivated through the roof after what happened last time\". The Spanish champions won in 2018 thanks to goals from Karim Benzema and two by Gareth Bale, including a spectacular overhead kick. Salah left the field in tears after injuring his shoulder in the 30th minute having been pulled down by centre-back Ramos, who has since joined Paris St-Germain. A year later Liverpool beat Tottenham in the final in Madrid to win the European crown. Klopp also said Thiago Alcantara has a \"good chance\" of recovering to play at Stade de France. The Spain midfielder was substituted at half-time of the Reds' 3-1 win over Wolves in their final Premier League game on Sunday with an Achilles injury. \"He will train this afternoon,\" Klopp said. \"At the moment it looks like he can be part of training tomorrow. That would be really helpful. \"It's surprisingly good. After the game I was not really positive about it, but we got news that night that it doesn't look that bad.

{"title": "Champions League final: The Real Madrid youngsters ready to take over from club legends", "content": "As Real Madrid's ageing stars watched on from the touchline while their younger counterparts saw out a remarkable Champions League semi-final victory, it was evidence that the club's immediate and longer term future may be in better shape than many critics have suggested. None of Karim Benzema, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos or Casemiro was on the pitch as the final whistle went on  a 6-5 aggregate success over Manchester City  that earned Carlo Ancelotti's side a spot in Saturday's final against Liverpool. Rodrygo wrote his name into Real folklore with two late goals to take that tie to extra time, Eduardo Camavinga glided across the turf making the Bernabeu his own and Federico Valverde's engine was still whirring after 120 minutes. Brazil forward Vinicius Junior, whose tally of 51 appearances this season is more than any of his team-mates, scored a superb solo effort in the first leg and lasted until five minutes from time in the second. In many ways - despite the frustration at  failing to land Kylian Mbappe  from Paris St-Germain and the problems that may arise from that - this Champions League run has seen president Florentino Perez's transfer strategy of the past few years come to fruition, with the talented prospects he has invested in delivering on their potential at key moments to put Real on the verge of a 14th European Cup triumph. It has also provided a glimpse of the evolution at the La Liga champions as Modric and Benzema enter their twilight years following a decade at the club in which they helped deliver four Champions Leagues. Alongside Kroos and Gareth Bale, they are the stars remaining from the early years of Perez's second tenure in which the 'Galactico' approach that characterised his first stint as president continued. In the early 2000s, the arrival of Luis Figo from rivals Barcelona was followed by high-profile acquisitions of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, David Beckham and Michael Owen. On Perez's return in 2009, it was Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo to kick things off. Since James Rodriguez's arrival after the 2014 World Cup, the only real Galactico business Madrid have done was splashing an initial £89m on a 28-year-old Eden Hazard from Chelsea. The rest of their recruitment has focused largely on younger prospects - albeit by no means cheap - or free transfers. Last summer David Alaba's free transfer from Bayern Munich and the £28m move for teenage Rennes midfielder Camavinga were the only incomings, following a season of no signings. Former Real boss Jorge Valdano analysed the situation in 2017. \"Did Florentino change?\" he asked. \"No. The market changed. Now it's incredibly difficult for the club to be able to wait for a talent to mature into a Ballon d'Or winner and then buy them just because you're Real Madrid.\" Real's pursuit of Vinicius highlighted their strategy of trying to sweep up the best young players in the world, with chief scout Juni Calafat - who also spotted Rodrygo and defender Eder Militao - travelling to Brazil to secure Vinicius' signature when he was only 16 and had played only 17 minutes of senior football for Flamengo. Vinicius completed his move to Madrid in a deal worth £39m once he turned 18 in July 2018. \"Vinicius and I made the jump from Flamengo to Real Madrid. But there is a big difference,\" says former Brazil winger Savio, who signed in 1997. \"I left Flamengo when I was 23, almost 24. I left with a bit more experience. I learned a lot of things in the first season, mainly in terms of changing countries, football, tactics. \"But Vinicius was 18 years old, a very young player. He practically jumps from Flamengo, from the youth teams, to the first team. So there were still things to learn, to take to the pitch in terms of technique and tactics. \"Real Madrid is a very big change. In the first season and second season he got to know the club better - how they play - because between South American football and European football is a very big change. It was a question of time to get to know the tactics, the style of play, the style of the club.\" That transfer is bearing fruit, particularly this season with 21-year-old Vinicius producing his best return to date - scoring 21 times in all competitions, registering 20 assists and forging a formidable partnership with prolific 34-year-old Benzema. \"With all the change and with all the difficulties he has had in the first few seasons, he never stopped being the Vinicius I saw in Flamengo,\" says Savio. \"That is the one-on-ones, the individual quality. This year he is showing more and more of his potential and talent.\" One question mark for Real is who will succeed the long-standing midfield trio of Modric, Kroos and Casemiro, who are 36, 32 and 30 respectively. Former Real defender Fernando Hierro, Ancelotti's assistant during his first spell at the club, believes 19-year-old France international Camavinga and 23-year-old Uruguayan Valverde - signed from Penarol six years ago - have the quality to fill that void. \"Modric is ageing like fine wine. Let's hope he can perform at this level for one or two more years,\" says Hierro. \"Adapting to a club like Real Madrid is not easy and Camavinga and Valverde are really prepared to step in.\" Ex-Real playmaker Guti agrees. \"Fede is really a very talented player,\" he says. \"He should just prove it on the pitch, more so than he has done so far because he has got a great talent. \"Camavinga is really another very talented player. Of course it is not easy to replace someone like Modric. If you give them time, those two will really grow and perform very well at Real Madrid.\" Camavinga arrived as one of the most sought-after prospects in Europe and Ancelotti has described him as \"the present and the future of the club\", calling on his young midfielders to learn from the experienced professionals around them. \"They are competing with the best in the world and they must evaluate and understand that in the future they will be the ones playing there,\" Ancelotti told Spanish newspaper AS. \"Camavinga has immense quality and power, but he must learn and gain experience and knowledge for the position in which he plays. He doesn't have it yet, but he's only 19 years old. \"Every day that he trains with Modric, Kroos or Casemiro is a master's degree - I'm sure he learns more from what he sees his team-mates do in training than from what I tell him.\" On Valverde, who has also been deployed as a right-sided forward, Ancelotti said: \"Valverde is showing all his qualities. Whenever he has the chance, he has to shoot because he can shoot incredibly well. He also brings physicality and verticality, which is rare in a modern midfielder.\" That is not to say there will not be any investment this summer - Real have been heavily linked with 22-year-old Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni and no doubt there will be key signings after missing out on Mbappe. But Ancelotti is confident about the future. \"We have the ideal relief for these legends of the club,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61553345"},

{"title": "Liverpool v Real Madrid: Champions League final a chance to end special season in style - Warnock", "content": "This has already been a season like no other for Liverpool, and it's only right they have a chance to end it in style. Saturday's Champions League final against Real Madrid has been the focus since the dying moments of the Premier League campaign last weekend, when everyone at Anfield realised the title - and their hopes of an unprecedented quadruple - were gone. However things had turned out, though, the important thing was that there was always one more game to go. We already know what to expect from Jurgen Klopp's side in Paris, because we have seen it for the past 10 months now. To win the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and push Manchester City all the way in the league, they have needed the same outlook that has brought them so many of their victories this season - a calmness and belief that their quality will get them over the line in the end. Lots of things have come together to get them to this point, but back in August there were plenty of reasons people doubted whether Liverpool would win anything at all this season, let alone having a chance of ending it with three trophies. Every great team has to overcome adversity at some stage and Liverpool certainly did that 12 months ago to turn things around at the very end of a disappointing and injury-plagued campaign.  It has undoubtedly set them up for what they have achieved this season too - it's easy to forget they almost didn't get a chance to go for a quadruple at all, yet they ended up coming closer to a historic clean sweep than  any English team has done before. You look at this team and what they are doing now and you think going for the Champions League and challenging for the title is just where they should be because of the quality they have. But they wouldn't even have made it into last season's top four but for Alisson's extraordinary 95th-minute winner against West Brom last May. It was almost written in the stars that the Brazil goalkeeper would be the player to do something amazing like that, after his father, Jose, had drowned in a tragic accident a few weeks earlier. There was far more to their turnaround than just that moment, though. It was the last 10 league games that were the key to salvaging that campaign - Liverpool won eight and drew two of them. The revival was sparked by Klopp's decision to move Fabinho from a makeshift defender role back into midfield, as the screen in front of two young centre-backs. It worked, brilliantly. As well as securing third place, that run of results changed the mood around the club. It boosted the players' confidence, and affected the way the fans were thinking. Instead of being worried about what was to come, they turned up for the start of this season anticipating the same sort of performances and results, and the team have delivered. Back in August, I never even contemplated that Liverpool would end up winning both domestic cups. Since he arrived at the club in 2015, Klopp had never prioritised either the League Cup or FA Cup and it was the same in the early stages of both competitions this time too. He put young sides out but they got through each round, and he got a bit fortunate with the draws - which you need to be - along the way. There were still some big hurdles to get past, of course. They ended up beating City on the way to lifting the FA Cup and had to overcome Chelsea in both finals, so you could never say they did it the easy way. But Klopp did not go into this season and announce 'we're going for everything'. It is the way it fell, and sometimes that works out just great.  They have proved plenty of people wrong along the way, and it was the same in the Premier League too.  I didn't put them in the hunt for the title before the season started because I thought January - when Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane went away for the Africa Cup of Nations - would prove too big a problem. I was also unsure whether we would see the best of Virgil van Dijk on his return from an eight-month absence with a cruciate ligament injury. I don't think anyone envisaged him playing virtually every game, but he has. When a centre-half has been rested it's usually been Joel Matip or Ibrahima Konate - Van Dijk has been just as awesome a presence as he was before. You have to give credit to Klopp and his staff for managing his return but Van Dijk deserves some too, because he said he would not play for the Netherlands in the European Championship in order to focus on his recovery.  He wanted to be ready for Liverpool's season. In hindsight, what a crucial decision that was. Klopp's ability to manage his squad and rest players at key times has obviously been pivotal in landing so many trophies this season. But last summer, I don't think people appreciated how much depth he had. Maybe it was because we were yet to see the very best of Thiago Alcantara, but midfield was a potential problem because of Georginio Wijnaldum's departure to Paris St-Germain. That wasn't just because of how good Wijnaldum was - it was also his injury record. He was always fit and available for every game, while everyone else in there seemed to miss matches. It felt like Liverpool lost their mainstay when he left, but in the end it didn't matter. It was the same in January and the start of February when they won all six games they played in all competitions while Salah and Mane were away at Afcon. To get through that period and stay in contention for everything was huge… and can you imagine the buzz in the dressing room when those two came back? Everyone would have been thinking 'we are going to kick on even more'. Luis Diaz's signing in January turned out to be another Klopp masterstroke because he has brought something fresh to Liverpool's attack, but I would say the team has been evolving anyway. A couple of years ago, it felt as if they had to be this dominant side who blew teams away in order to succeed. Now they have different ways to win games. It means they can play open, expansive football when it works - but they can also be a counter-attacking side or even be dogged and defensive when it is needed. What I've noticed more this season is their ability to squeeze the pitch and condense the play into the areas they want. They play with such a high line but their ability to catch the opposition offside is just phenomenal. Another reason that works so well is Alisson - if people do beat their offside trap, they can rely on him being incredible in one-on-one situations. It still takes such bravery to set up like that, and leave yourself open, but Liverpool are happy to do it.  It's part of what makes them a great team - they have got a toughness and an arrogance, plus an understanding that they need to take risks sometimes in order to win a game. Liverpool suffocate teams by being horrible to play against but they have patience too, which means they don't panic if the goals don't come or things don't go their way. The fans are the same. I actually noticed the change in their attitude a few years ago, when Liverpool came back from 1-0 down to beat Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield in December 2018. They expect the team to find an answer, like they did in winning their final four league games of the season after going behind on each occasion. There is a calmness about this Liverpool side and that's why no-one gave up on the title either, even when City were a long way in front in January. The gap is always talked about as having been 14 points but in reality it was a little less than that because of Liverpool's two games in hand. Still, eight points is a lot to make up on a team as good as City and just taking them to the final day of the season was a great achievement. It didn't quite happen for them on Sunday, but Liverpool can look back without any regrets because they found a way to take care of their own business, and beat Wolves. They have become very good at doing that. This has already been a season beyond anyone's expectations - but if Liverpool do finish it off by beating Real Madrid then I don't think anyone would be surprised.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61538720"},
{"title": "Champions League final: How Kylian Mbappe fallout has affected Real Madrid's build-up", "content": "This was supposed to be a dream seven days for Real Madrid. Announce the signing of Kylian Mbappe - arguably the world's most coveted player - at the start of the week, and win the Champions League at the end of it. That was the expectation from club president Florentino Perez, who had been ultra confident a deal for the World Cup-winning France forward would be done. That Mbappe  chose to stay at Paris St-Germain  has not gone down well. The Madrid press have been apoplectic, to the point that in the early part of this week all coverage was about the non-deal rather than the small matter of Saturday's final against Liverpool. The fallout has involved Karim Benzema courting controversy, but may actually end up being good news for some of the Bernabeu club's key players. Either way, it has certainly not been the build-up to their bid for a 14th Champions League title that Real Madrid had been expecting. While Liverpool's preparations for the Paris final have involved coming to terms with the disappointment of missing out on the Premier League title by a point to Manchester City, the Real Madrid squad have had an entirely different setback to contend with. There is certainly an element of disappointment coming from within their camp at the failure to sign Mbappe, because many of the group were looking forward to the chance of playing with him, not least because they had been assured his arrival was a done deal. The Madrid media felt the same, and the main reason for the subsequent furore is that all they had heard recently - or believed - was Perez's version of events. According to sources close to the president, everything was agreed. Mbappe had started to look for a property in Madrid, his presentation to the adoring fans was already being organised and Perez had actually said in private meetings and dinners that it was all done. Perez told everyone the player was counting the days before he came and the rejection over the past eight months of a new contract offer from PSG only served to confirm their beliefs that this was in fact the case. But Mbappe always said unequivocally that he would make his decision at the end of the season. Real Madrid told him he had to choose between money and glory, and there has been plenty of talk this week that he opted for money. His motivation was certainly more than just financial, though. Despite what you may have read or heard, in Mbappe's mind he did not say \"no\" to Real Madrid, but rather  \"yes\" to PSG  and to staying in his native France. That was clear to me when I met him in Paris this week to  interview him for BBC Sport. In the end there was very little to choose between the offers on the table from both clubs, and the player firmly believes he has unfinished business in Paris. For the 23-year-old, money was of course a factor, but it is also about love - which he has in abundance in Paris - and power, the three things humans crave. The player will now become the focal point of the club and everyone is going to have to adapt to it. And yes, that includes Lionel Messi. Let's see how that works. Mbappe is also more than aware of the fact that by the end of his lucrative new contract he will be just 26 and presumably at his absolute peak. Anything can happen then; never say never. Real Madrid's current star man, Karim Benzema, is 34 and might not still be at the club when that deal expires. Perhaps that helps explain his  bizarre Instagram posting  of a picture of Tupac Shakur, with an image in the background of a 'friend' of the rapper who supposedly betrayed the artist before his murder in 1996. This was seen as a less-than-subtle signal to highlight Mbappe's own 'betrayal'. The pair are France team-mates, of course, and Mbappe was quick to point out that in his opinion this infantile response had more to do with the powers that be at Real Madrid making mischief than something that had emanated from Benzema himself. Certainly, Benzema has not been impressed with being embroiled in the saga and it actually took his intervention to change the mood this week. He effectively pressed the reset button on Tuesday during a Champions League media day, saying the moment was long gone for discussing these minor matters and it was now time to concentrate on the match. There are two people involved in Saturday's final who probably won't exactly be heartbroken at Mbappe's no-show in Madrid, namely Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo. Vinicius has played more minutes than any other Real Madrid player this season and has been a standout performer in the Champions League. Rodrygo has been used less regularly, but delivered arguably European football's moments of the season when he scored twice in the dying moments of their Champions League semi-final against Manchester City to keep the tie alive. More backing for Vinicius, who incidentally was told as a 16-year-old that the club were looking to him rather than Mbappe as its future, is now inevitable. Suddenly his potential importance to the Spanish champions has grown significantly. Vinicius will probably benefit from not having to look over his shoulder. New contracts for him and Rodrygo are being negotiated as I write. Neither are 'an Mbappe', but Real Madrid now realise this is the coat that they must cut their cloth to. They can no longer compete in the buying of superstars and will have to go down the road of signing prodigiously talented youngsters, like the aforementioned pair and also Eduardo Camavinga, turning them into superstars. The big question now is where does this whole off-field saga leave Real Madrid and its president? There is no doubt it is time for a reality check for Perez and the club as a whole. Neither are accustomed to coming off second best in any transfer negotiations, but even they have to accept the timing of these huge deals is now in the hands of the players, because Mbappe's handling of this situation - letting his contract run down and waiting until the end of the season to announce his decision - has changed the transfer landscape. Perez is a supremely astute leader with a killer instinct, and previous dealings have shown the footballing world that what he and Real Madrid want, they invariably get. But not any more. The arrival on to the scene of state-linked clubs like Manchester City (Abu Dhabi) and PSG (Qatar) has brought a seismic change to European football. The pecking order has been transformed both on and off the pitch, with the game's two young superstars deciding to trust their future for the time being at least to these clubs - Erling Haaland to Manchester City and Mbappe to PSG - rather than the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Real Madrid's inability to get the Mbappe deal over the line means they have not only lost weight and prestige in the market in the eyes of the watching world, but most importantly they have lost face. That is not a nice feeling for a club that regards itself as the most important in the world. But with all that said, the disappointment of missing out on Mbappe shouldn't hide the fact Real Madrid are still very well run, with manageable debt despite rebuilding the stadium, with a squad that is evolving and which will get younger this summer. And let's not forget they are one game away from completing a La Liga and Champions League double.  When I spent time with them in Madrid on Tuesday they seemed to have the serenity of serial winners, the calm heads of those used to being in major finals. The players entered the biggest week of the season as if they were walking around a beach in flip flops. It is not arrogance. It is the feeling that, in a way, they have nothing to lose - but with the confidence they have a good chance to win. Yes, they lack that extra dimension that a Galactico would give them in the commercial world.  But how much do they even need one on the pitch itself? We might find out against Liverpool on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61594749"},
{"title": "Liverpool v Real Madrid: How Gareth Bale has gone from hero to forgotten man", "content": "When Real Madrid face Liverpool in Saturday's Champions League final, one potential match-winner will be conspicuous by his expected absence from the pitch. Gareth Bale - the two-goal hero when the teams met in  2018's final  - has become a forgotten man, making only seven Real appearances all season and starting just one game in club colours since August. Manager Carlo Ancelotti has declared Bale, 32, fit for the final after a back problem, but he has only played 22 minutes for the team since February and is extremely unlikely to feature. With his contract at the Bernabeu expiring next month, his nine-year spell in Spain is limping to the quietest of endings, and it is fair to suggest his departure will come as a great relief to all parties. For a player who has scored 106 goals and won 15 trophies in Spain to become arguably British football's greatest ever export, it is a terribly sad way to finish - and even more of a shame because it all started so well.  When Bale was  signed by Real  for 100m euros from Tottenham in 2013, he immediately became a key component of a breathtakingly exciting forward line alongside Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. Bale was quickly embraced by Real fans - especially when he concluded his first season by winning the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona with a stupendous solo goal, and then netted in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid to help seal Real's long-awaited tenth European crown. But the first signs of trouble soon arrived. Early in 2015 Real suffered a bad run of form, including a 4-0 thrashing at Atletico and a 4-3 Champions League defeat by Schalke.  Some sections of the media made Bale the scapegoat for those poor results, lambasting him with criticism that seemed excessive and fostered a theory that their attacks on Bale were really an indirect way of getting at Real president Florentino Perez - theories they denied. Bale appeared to be stung by the ferocity of the criticism, but since arriving in Spain he rarely connected with Real fans or the media, only conducting one heavily staged interview in Spanish and by all accounts living a sheltered life. His perception was soon further damaged by a series of injuries which often cleared up just in time for him to go on international duty with Wales, provoking accusations that Bale's club career had moved below playing for his country on his list of priorities. Those factors combined to create a negative spiral in the relationships between Bale, the tabloid Spanish media, a section of Real fans and even the club itself. And with Bale generally quietly retreating into his small inner circle rather than trying to rescue his reputation, that situation of distrust was never escaped. The mutual loathing between Bale and the Spanish media reached its low point in March, when sports newspaper Marca described Bale as a \"parasite\" after he missed the Clasico home loss to Barcelona, supposedly through injury, but promptly went away on international duty to start and score twice for Wales against Austria.  Although he has usually not responded to such criticism,  on this occasion he bit back,  tweeting his disgust by describing the attack as \"slanderous, derogatory and speculative journalism,\" and concluding: \"We all know who the real parasite is!\" Bale was certainly not primarily responsible for instigating the spiral of negativity. The fact that he has never been accused of dressing-room dissent, despite his well-chronicled troubles, shows that he was not a troublemaker; but neither was he a peacemaker, instead preferring to remain aloof and alone. That means he will be remembered by Real fans with respect for the player he initially was, but also with scorn for the disinterested, peripheral presence he later became. In the final analysis, the unhappy ending to Bale's time at Real Madrid reflects badly on everybody: the club, which could have supported him much better and at times hung him out to dry; the media, which has often been excessive in its criticism; the fans, many of whom too easily swallowed the negative stories they were served and too quickly forgot his accomplishments. And, it must be said, Bale himself, who struggled to engage as he was latterly portrayed in Spain - whether fairly or not - as the ultimate example of a modern mercenary footballer, disconnected from his community and only interested in picking up a bloated salary. There is a common Spanish phrase to describe a glorious departure: 'salir por la puerta grande' - to go out through the main entrance. Brazilian left-back Marcelo, for example, is being accorded such a fond farewell as his contract with Real also draws to a conclusion, receiving a rousing ovation during his team's final game of the season against Real Betis on Friday. Bale, in contrast, was not even seen inside the stadium for that game and was recently dismissively described by Madrid-based sports newspaper AS as sneaking out of the club \"through the cat flap\".  That is a fair description and, however you view the rights and wrongs of the breakdown in relationships, it is a sad way for such a wonderful player to leave a club where he achieved so much.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61576898"},
{"title": "Liverpool v Real Madrid: Mohamed Salah out for revenge in Champions League final", "content": "Mohamed Salah's Champions League final motivation was summed up in a six-word tweet posted moments after Real Madrid completed a dramatic resurrection against Manchester City to set up a meeting in Paris.  \"We have a score to settle,\" announced Salah, a superstar of few words but barely able to conceal the hint of menace in his message to the team responsible for the worst night of his Liverpool career.  When Liverpool meet Real Madrid in the Stade de France on Saturday, memories of a balmy May evening in Kyiv four years ago - when Jurgen Klopp's side were  beaten 3-1  - will be painfully revived for Salah.  That night in Ukraine contained many striking images, from the sight of Liverpool keeper Loris Karius alone and in tears at the final whistle after his calamitous performance gifted Real two goals, to the acrobatic bicycle kick from Gareth Bale to put Real on the path to victory.  But for Liverpool, it was the sight of a tearful Salah receiving a consoling pat from Cristiano Ronaldo as he walked off heartbroken after only 30 minutes, following a mischievous tangle with Real's enforcer-in-chief Sergio Ramos that encapsulated the agony.  Ramos, of course, pleaded his innocence but Salah and Liverpool will never sway from the belief he was targeted by a master of the defensive dark arts, a challenge and fall that caused serious damage to Salah's shoulder, forcing his early departure.  Liverpool manager Klopp was measured as he said: \"I don't believe in revenge or think revenge is a fantastic idea. I understand what Mo said. He wants to put it right, but in Germany we say you always meet twice in life.\"  Klopp's words somewhat overlook the fact that he and Salah actually met Real Madrid again and came out on the wrong end of a 3-1 aggregate score in last season's quarter-final. However, those games were staged in surreal atmospheres behind closed doors.  This is different. This is the Champions League final and there can be no question that Salah will be, as he said himself, \"very motivated - motivated through the roof\".  Klopp may play down talk of revenge, but Salah's tweet told the tale. If revenge is a dish best served cold, Salah wants to pluck something right from the bottom of the deep freeze for Carlo Ancelotti's side.  And this is a much more powerful and rounded Liverpool than the side overcome by Real Madrid following Salah's injury and rare managerial mis-step from Klopp, who paid a heavy price for keeping faith with a goalkeeper in Karius who was nowhere near the required standard.  Salah was having a stellar first season at Liverpool with 44 goals in 51 games before that 2018 final. When he went off he was replaced by Adam Lallana, who had only made 14 appearances and played 395 minutes without scoring a goal that season.  This is no slight on Lallana, merely confirmation that Klopp was juggling limited resources last time the Reds met Real in the Champions League final. Now he has vast riches at his disposal.  Klopp would never want to lose Salah, although the FA Cup was won against Chelsea after he suffered a first-half injury. Liverpool now have a dazzling array of attacking options should problems arise.  As well as Salah, Liverpool have the tried and trusted Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, as well as free-scoring Diogo Jota plus the explosive Colombian Luis Diaz, a transformative January signing from Porto.  Salah is still Liverpool's main man when it comes to goals, with 31 goals in 50 appearances this season, and Saturday is the chance for Liverpool, not just the Anfield idol known as 'The Egyptian King', to set the record straight.  Stade de France was bathed in warm sunshine and heavy humidity on Thursday afternoon as the pageantry was being planned and the final touches put in place for Europe's biggest club occasion, which will have Salah as one of its star turns.  The teams arrive on Friday, when Klopp and Ancelotti, seeking a record fourth Champions League win as a manager, will face the media, and Liverpool and Real will train on a surface that was still being worked on throughout Thursday. Klopp's playing down of the revenge motive may well have been a psychological ploy to stop Salah taking too much on his own shoulders, trying too hard when his side have enough weaponry to go around.  Salah has dominated the build-up to this showpiece and, as Liverpool fans started to arrive in the French capital on Thursday, pouring off Eurostar at Gare du Nord, the 29-year-old's name and image were very much in evidence.  It is not just that Salah is clearly intent on writing a redemption story, the sub-plot also features his own long-term future at Anfield.  The new contract Liverpool want Salah to commit to remains unsigned and while his declaration that he will be at Anfield \"for sure\" next season is a short-term lift, it does not clarify whether he will commit to the club. Indeed, it only adds to the possibility he could walk away for free in 12 months' time. Salah certainly holds all the cards.  But this, for now, is a side issue.  The main priority is Saturday in the swirling bowl of Stade de France.  Salah has waited four years since he sat in a Kyiv hospital, helpless and in agony, as Liverpool suffered that agonising defeat. The tweet once the date with Real Madrid was set in the diary was concrete evidence of just how much this means to him.  Liverpool's dream of a historic quadruple is over after Manchester City's miraculous five minutes against Aston Villa clinched the Premier League on the final day of the season, but the Champions League can still complete a magnificent treble trophy haul with the EFL Cup and FA Cup already safely pocketed.  And no-one in the Stade de France will be more determined to make that happen than Mohamed Salah, a man on a mission that has been four years in the making.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61604022"},
{"title": "Rangers and Hearts' Euro opponents Napoli and Fiorentina fire blanks in Serie A draw", "content": "Rangers and Heart of Midlothian will be hoping that their forthcoming European opponents from Serie A remain as toothless as they were on Sunday after Napoli and Fiorentina cancelled one another out in an entertaining but goalless draw. Napoli, who will face the Ibrox side in Champions League Group A, stay top of the Italian top flight on goal difference despite failing to add to their victories in opening two fixtures in which they scored nine times with only two in reply. Hosts Fiorentina, who take on Hearts in the Europa Conference League, remain unbeaten in five games - including their two-leg qualifier against Twente Enschede - but Vincenzo Italiano's side have now endured three consecutive 0-0 draws. Italy midfielder Giacomo Bonaventura threatened to break that trend for the home side with an early strike just wide before Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen found the net on the turn from close range for Luciano Spalletti's visitors only to be ruled offside. Napoli's Mexico winger, Hirving Lozano, missed the best chance of the game as he headed wide from close range after the break. Winger Riccardo Sottil had looked dangerous with a couple of shots straight at Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret before setting up on-loan Hellas Verona midfielder Antonin Barak, but the Czech Republic international's 15-yard drive skimmed just past. Two more loanees were also prominent as Sassuolo's Italy forward, Giacomo Raspadori, forced a good, one-handed save from Pierluigi Gollini, the Atalanta goalkeeper currently with Fiorentina. Whereas the Scottish Premiership already looks like a two-horse race between Celtic and Rangers, with Hearts the best of the rest, the draw means Napoli are in a six-way tie at the top of Serie A with AC Milan, Lazio, Atalanta, Torino and Roma, with Fiorentina two points behind in ninth. Napoli are the first of Rangers' group opponents to visit Ibrox, on 13 September, six days after the Glasgow side's trip to face Ajax and before their double header with Liverpool. Liverpool, of course, sent out a warning not just to their group opponents but Europe as a whole with  Saturday's 9-0 demolition  of visitors Bournemouth in the Premier League, while Ajax remain two points clear at the top of the Eredivisie after Sunday's 2-0 win away to Utrecht. Fiorentina don't meet Hearts until they visit Tynecastle on 6 October.  The Edinburgh side's two other Conference League opponents, Istanbul Basaksehir and Rigas FS, did not play at the weekend.  The Turks sit fourth in the Super Lig after three games, while the Latvians lie third in their domestic league after 25 matches ahead of Monday's trip to face fourth-top Liepaja. Meanwhile, Celtic's opening Champions League opponents, reigning champions Real Madrid, remain top of La Liga on goal difference from Real Betis after Sunday's  3-1 win away to Espanyol. Shakhtar Donetsk recorded their first win of the fledgling relaunched Ukrainian top flight, beating Kryvbas 1-0, while RB Leipzig sit ninth in the Bundesliga after five games following a 2-0 home win over Wolfsburg.

Up to  60,000 Liverpool fans  - many without tickets - are expected in the French capital as Jurgen Klopp's Reds attempt to seal an FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Champions League treble in their 63rd and final game of 2021-22. However, Real Madrid are record 13-time winners and their Italian boss Carlo Ancelotti is looking to win the competition for a fourth time - the most by any manager in the tournament's history - after leading AC Milan (2002-03, 2006-07) and Real (2013-14) to European glory. Liverpool head into their third Champions League final in five seasons on the back of the disappointment of narrowly losing out to Manchester City in the Premier League title race last weekend. \"We are all in a good mood. If you are healthy, as the boys obviously are, life gives you opportunities again and again and in this case it is the Champions League final,\" said Reds boss Klopp. The German added: \"Three finals in five years is exceptional because this competition is really difficult. It is really special. We really want to give it a proper go and we will see.\" While Liverpool are looking to seal a cup treble, Real are attempting a league and European double after being crowned champions of Spain. By steering Real to a  35th La Liga title  last month, Ancelotti became the first manager to win the league in all five of Europe's major leagues. \"Two great teams will face each other, and the one with more courage and personality will win at the end,\" said former Chelsea boss Ancelotti. The final will be decided on the day with extra time and penalties coming into play if the sides cannot be separated. Saturday's eagerly anticipated final brings together two super heavyweights of European football. While Real Madrid are aiming to win it for a 14th time, which would then be twice as many as any other club, a Liverpool win would take them level with AC Milan (7) in second place on the list of overall champions. Liverpool's Senegal forward Sadio Mane and Real Madrid's France forward Karim Benzema are both in the running to win this year's coveted Ballon d'Or which is awarded to the world's best player. Benzema, 34, has struck 15 goals in Europe this season - including two hat-tricks - and is the Champions League's leading scorer in 2021-22, while Mane was instrumental in his country's  first Africa Cup of Nations  triumph in February. Mane also helped Senegal qualify for the 2022 World Cup, with the 30-year-old winning two domestic cups with Liverpool this season. Linked with a move away from from the Reds this summer, Mane said he will give a  \"special\" answer  over his future after the final.  Mohamed Salah said earlier this month Liverpool had \"a score to settle\" with Real after losing 3-1 to the Spanish giants in the 2018 final in Kyiv. Four years ago, the Egypt star left the pitch in tears after falling heavily following a challenge by Sergio Ramos. \"I want to play against them and hopefully win it from them as well,\" added Salah, who has yet to extend his contract that expires in June 2023. This is the third time Liverpool and Real have met in the final. As well as 2018, the two clubs met in 1981 when Liverpool emerged 1-0 winners in Paris. Forty-one years later, will history repeat itself? Real Madrid have lost four times in 12 Champions League matches this season - Liverpool have lost three out of 62 matches in all competitions in 2021-22 - yet the champions of Spain have made it through to their 17th final in the competition. They have defeated Liverpool's Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City along the way but suffered a surprise home defeat to  Moldova's Sheriff Tiraspol  in the group stage last September. Real  came back from the abyss  in their semi-final against City. Trailing Pep Guardiola's side 5-3 on aggregate with just one minute of normal time remaining in the second leg,  Brazilian substitute Rodrygo scored twice to force extra time. Benzema, who has scored seven Champions League goals against English teams this season, then sent Ancelotti's side to Paris with a penalty. European club football's showpiece final, which is expected to be watched by a  global television audience of up to 400 million,  is being held in Paris after Russia was stripped of the event following the nation's invasion of Ukraine. It was scheduled to be played in St Petersburg but  Uefa announced in February  it would instead move the match to the Stade de France. Paris has been given just three months to prepare, well short of the usual 18. It is the third year running the venue of the Champions League final has been moved - the previous two because of the coronavirus pandemic. The last time the Stade de France staged the Champions League final was in 2006 when  Barcelona defeated Arsenal . French authorities are braced for an influx of up to 60,000 Liverpool supporters as Paris prepares for the Champions League final. Most have travelled without a ticket for the match by coach, train, plane and boat to soak up the atmosphere. Around  7,000 police will be on duty  while authorities have prepared a vast fan zone for up to 45,000 Liverpool fans along the Cours de Vincennes, a major avenue in the east of Paris, six miles from the stadium. There will be 75,000 inside the Stade de France but only 20,000 tickets have been made available to each side, with a further 12,000 offered for sale to fans worldwide. The remaining 23,000 tickets have been distributed to national associations, commercial partners, broadcasters, and Uefa's official hospitality programme. More than one-fifth of Liverpool's ticket allocation was for tickets that  cost between £410 and £578 . Liverpool John Lennon Airport has put on 34 extra flights to take around 9,000 supporters to Paris on Friday and Saturday, with 13 flights for fans departing on Friday and 21 flights departing on Saturday morning. However, fans travelling to France faced long queues at the Port of Dover. Some complained of \"chaos\" after being stuck in hours-long queues alongside families heading for half-term holidays.

Former Real midfielder Guti is confident the decision has already been taken for Ancelotti to remain at the Bernabeu next term, regardless of whether they beat City.  \"I think the decision is made, Ancelotti will stay,\" Guti told BBC Sport. \"It would be great for Real Madrid to to play the final but I think Carlo Ancelotti has really completed an excellent season.\" Pep Guardiola, who will come up against the veteran boss again on Wednesday, says he is an admirer of Ancelotti and congratulated him for winning the Spanish title when they met last week. \"He has been all around the world and always did an incredible job and his football always is really good,\" said Guardiola. \"He knows always what he has to do and apart from that is an exceptional person.

So I think that Ancelotti really should stay. \"We had Miguel Munoz, Vicente del Bosque, Zinedine Zidane, Ancelotti again - this is the type of coach with which Real Madrid has really thrived. \"Historically, it is not a club that is easy to manage but there is strong demand from both coaches and the team.\" Hierro has also been particularly impressed by Karim Benzema this season - a player he worked with during Ancelotti's first spell in Madrid - and says the 34-year-old France forward has achieved \"superstar\" status at the club, scoring 14 goals so far in this Champions League campaign.  \"Karim is an extraordinary player,\" said Hierro. \"Really when I was assistant to Ancelotti I realised Karim is an extraordinary player, how he combines and links with his team-mates. \"The truth is when Cristiano Ronaldo left the club I did not really know who was going to score and Benzema's performances came as a surprise. \"When he was playing with Gareth Bale and Cristiano, he was not as ambitious but now he is an extraordinary player, he is Ballon d'Or quality, he has really taken a step forward and his performance is absolutely phenomenal. Even though he has always been a great player.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61310122"},
{"title": "Liverpool quadruple bid: How the Reds are closer than any other English club to historic haul", "content": "Whether you love Liverpool or loathe them, or somewhere in between, we are all wondering the same thing now ... will they win one, two, three or all four trophies this season? With less than a month left, an unprecedented quadruple no longer seems an impossible dream. In fact, even with only the Carabao Cup secured so far, the Reds can already claim they are closer to it than any English side has managed before. Many have tried too. Since it first became achievable in 1960, there have been 120 other attempts by 15 clubs to become champions of England, conquer Europe and win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same campaign. We have seen three different trebles from those teams, 17 more did a double of some kind - like the one Manchester City are still chasing this season - and 36 occasions where a side lifted one of the required trophies, a list Chelsea will join if they win the FA Cup. But Liverpool are the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season and, date-wise, no side has got this far into the season with their hopes still alive of an amazing clean sweep. You may think there is a glaring omission in the table above. Manchester United's 1998-99 Treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup was historic in its own right, and is rightly seen as the greatest trophy haul by an English team of any era. But Sir Alex Ferguson's side did not even get within six months of a quadruple because they went out of the League Cup to Tottenham in the quarter-finals on 2 December 1998. That meant no-one was talking about an Old Trafford clean sweep by Christmas that year, let alone trumpeting about it the following spring. Although, like Manchester City in 2019 and Liverpool in 1984, United still had plenty to celebrate then. Rather than their more famous Treble winners, the United team that came closest to all four trophies was their 2009 side, which won the Premier League and League Cup. They made it to within three wins of a quadruple but lost to Everton in the FA Cup last four and Barcelona in the Champions League final - and had to settle for 'only' two in the end. At the moment, Liverpool have just the one trophy in the bag.  This is the Reds' 24th attempt at a quadruple in the 47 seasons it has been possible since the League Cup was established in 1960-61 - the joint-most with United, who were denied an attempt in 1999-2000 when they did not take part in the FA Cup. While Liverpool won one of the required trophies in seven of those seasons, did a double of some kind in four more and managed one treble of the league title, European Cup and League Cup in 1984, until this campaign they had never even reached March still in with a chance of all four. The club's other recognised treble, of 2000-01, is a notable achievement too, but does not count as a quadruple attempt because they were not in the Champions League that season. Liverpool won the Uefa Cup, FA Cup and League Cup, while finishing third in the league. As remarkable as the Reds' season has been up to this point, it is the amount of silverware they eventually collect that will decide how it will be remembered. Not how long they had a chance of winning everything or how many games away from glory they ended up. Just ask Chelsea about that.  Until this week, Jose Mourinho's 2007 side had stayed in contention for the quadruple longer than any other English club.  That was only 15 years ago, but it has already been largely forgotten - and was even overlooked by many while it was happening. It is a timely warning of how quickly Liverpool's quest could unravel from here. Excitement is building at Anfield and far beyond with every victory by Jurgen Klopp's side, who were told last week  they would become 'immortal'  if they can achieve the feat. Yet there was no fanfare for Chelsea in 2007, when they became the first English side to make it into May with the League Cup in the bag and still chasing glory on the three other fronts. Chelsea's situation then was actually extremely similar to Klopp's task now. With four league games to go, the Blues were three points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United, not one. But, like Liverpool now, they were already safely into the FA Cup final and had just won the first leg of their Champions League semi-final too. The backdrop to their bid was very different, however. Newspaper reports about Chelsea at that time did, occasionally, mention their quadruple chances. But instead of celebrating Mourinho's achievements and wondering how much his team could win, the media was mostly speculating about  whether he would keep his job  beyond the end of the campaign. Rather than being asked repeatedly about a clean sweep - which, by the way, Mourinho thought was possible right until the end -  a rumoured fall-out with then-owner Roman Abramovich  meant he was being continually questioned about his own future. Slightly different then to Klopp signing a new Anfield contract last week - and the unrest behind the scenes clearly didn't help Mourinho. His side's title challenge foundered in the next set of fixtures. Eventual champions United recovered from being 2-0 down with 30 minutes left  to beat Everton 4-2  and opened up a five-point lead with three games to play - after Chelsea  could only draw 2-2 with  Bolton on the same day. Their quadruple bid was gone for good a couple of days later when Liverpool hit back in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final and ended up progressing on penalties after a 1-1 aggregate draw. Mourinho did have the sizeable consolation of winning the FA Cup a couple of weeks later to complete a domestic cup double in 2007, but those stories that he was on the brink proved correct as he made his first exit from Stamford Bridge that September. At least he went out with a bang.  Multiple successes in that manner were relatively rare in English football until the expansion of the Champions League in the late 1990s offered more opportunities for a quadruple - and 12 of the past 20 seasons have seen one team win at least two of the required trophies. This time, however, the silverware could still be shared around. Of the four English teams who had a quadruple chance at the beginning of the campaign, only Manchester United can be sure the keys to their trophy cabinet will not be needed this month. Their quadruple chances are long since over, but it is not inconceivable Manchester City and Chelsea could still end up with more to show for their season than Liverpool. City are not just trying to deny Klopp a clean sweep, they are chasing their own double of the Champions League and English League title - a feat managed only twice before, by Liverpool in 1977 and United in 2008.  Likewise, Chelsea are looking to beat the Reds and lift the FA Cup when they meet at Wembley on 14 May. Before the Premier League and Champions League era began in 1992, Burnley went closest to a quadruple, in 1960-61 - the first season four trophies were up for grabs in England - when they made it as far as 15 March before losing to Hamburg in the quarter-finals of the European Cup. Back then, quadruple opportunities were far more limited - the European Cup was restricted to just the league champions or holders and, for eight out of 10 seasons between 1961 and 1971, the clubs who qualified did not enter the League Cup. There was no chance of completing it between 1985 and 1991 either, as English clubs were barred from Europe for five years, and league champions Liverpool served an extra year's suspension in 1990-91. Since then, some great teams of the modern era have had a go at winning all four trophies - and United's Treble winners are not the only ones who have fallen short. City's 'Centurions' - the Pep Guardiola side that broke the 100-point mark and set an all-time English top-flight record for most points in a single campaign in 2017-18 - had their bid ended by Wigan Athletic, of League One, in the FA Cup fifth round on 19 February. Arsenal's legendary 'Invincibles' went the entire league campaign undefeated in 2003-04, but that was the only silverware they secured that season and their quadruple hopes were ended on 3 February by Middlesbrough, who beat them 3-1 on aggregate in the League Cup semi-finals.

{"title": "Kicking Off: The Rise and Fall of the Super League - what we learn in new BBC documentary", "content": "Plans for a European Super League have been around for more than 30 years, and Neymar's 2017 move to Paris-St Germain may have helped give them new life. They are just two things we learn in a new BBC Two documentary -  Kicking Off: The Rise and Fall of The Super League  - which airs in the UK from 21:30 BST on Wednesday, 4 May. Just over a year ago, it was  announced  that 12 of the world's biggest football clubs had agreed to sign up to a new breakaway elite competition.  The founding members included six Premier League teams - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - plus AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid. It was news to even the clubs' players and managers. Unlike the existing Champions League format, run by European governing body Uefa, the intention was for the ESL to include the same 15 teams each year - regardless of their domestic performance - with five further spaces open for other clubs to qualify annually. It effectively meant big clubs (historically 'big', at least) would be guaranteed entry. Uefa condemned the plans, the UK government came out against them, and thousands of fans protested.  Within 48 hours  the plans had spectacularly unravelled, with all six English teams withdrawing. The BBC documentary goes behind the headlines of the dramatic rise and fall - from the events that came together to inspire it, to the fallout afterwards. Among those interviewed are La Liga president Javier Tebas, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters, former England footballers Gary Lineker and Eniola Aluko, and a host of football journalists. Here are just a few takeaways: The idea of an elite European competition has been kicking around for longer than you may have thought. As the film explains, Silvio Berlusconi - media mogul, AC Milan owner, and future Italian Prime Minister - proposed something similar in the late 1980s. Berlusconi could not understand why the European Cup, as it was then called, was not being better exploited for television money. As the documentary narrator explains: \"For Berlusconi, it was ludicrous that the best clubs in Europe were not playing each other every week in lucrative matches, with easier entry to the competition and a little less chance of being knocked out too early.\" The plan was rejected, the idea was not. In truth, it's quite a reach to pin the whole thing on the Brazilian forward. But the documentary puts forward a good case as to why his transfer to Paris St-Germain in 2017 was something of a catalyst. When PSG triggered Neymar's buyout clause to sign him from Barcelona for a  world record 222m euros  (£200m), they upset the whole football landscape. Historic superpowers such as Barca and Real Madrid had new challengers in the market - the likes of PSG and Manchester City. \"They flooded the game with so much money and that had a chain reaction,\" journalist Miguel Delaney says in the documentary. \"It would just raise the market to such a point that they knew only a handful of clubs could compete.\" The ESL would give more clubs even more money.  The  official statement  announcing its inception said: \"In exchange for their commitment, founding clubs will receive an amount of 3.5bn euros solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the Covid pandemic.\" That extra cash was probably more attractive to clubs that had made some big losses in recent years. \"If you count the amount of money the so-called 'dirty dozen' had lost over the 2019-20 season, I think you go to 800m euros (£675m),\" says French football journalist Philippe Auclair. That was compounded by a global pandemic, with sporting events initially cancelled, then held behind closed doors. Masters estimates Premier League clubs missed out on more than £2bn of revenue during that period. For all of the furore about the ESL proposals,  critics  have argued that planned changes to the Champions League format do not honour the principles of fairness. A final decision is due to be taken over the format of Europe's elite club competition from 2024 when Uefa's executive committee meets in Vienna next week. The governing body is considering whether to ditch a controversial plan to award two Champions League places according to past performance. Put simply, should the initial plan be formalised, teams would be allowed to qualify based on historic clout alone. Masters does not think that concept is fair, saying in the documentary: \"I think the word is 'entitlement'. \"I believe in a European football pyramid, where empires rise and fall.\" The changes were  announced  in May 2021, just a month after the collapse of the ESL, but the proposals had been made earlier. As some fans in the film suggest, these changes could end up looking like a Super League in another form. What's more, Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid did not pull out of the 'original' ESL. \"The Super League won't go away because of the greed at the top of the game and the big clubs wanting to get bigger and richer and not caring too much about the small clubs,\" says Lineker. Will there be more opposition? \"We've proved that we can mobilise and make change,\" says Football Supporters' Association chief executive Kevin Miles, who was crucial in helping lead opposition to the ESL. \"It's not a once-and-forever victory, but if we can do it once, we can do it again.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61321460"},
{"title": "Villarreal v Liverpool: Does Unai Emery get respect he deserves?", "content": "532 Guiding unfancied Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals ought to have been a career highlight for Unai Emery, the manager who has taken a team from a town with a smaller population than Clacton-on-Sea to the pinnacle of European football. Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After  knocking out Juventus  in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal  stunned Bayern Munich,  whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following  a 2-0 defeat at Anfield,  a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as \"a disgrace\" to the Champions League, calling them \"pathetic\".  That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: \"Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!\" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61300016"},
{"title": "Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 on aggregate): Jurgen Klopp's side advance to Champions League final", "content": "2920 Liverpool survived a scare against Villarreal to move into the Champions League final - and keep their hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple alive. The Reds had comfortably won 2-0 in the first leg but that advantage was wiped out after only 41 minutes at a noisy and passionate El Madrigal as the Spanish side pushed for a huge upset. Boulaye Dia scored Villarreal's first after only three minutes, converting Etienne Capoue's pass, before ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin headed in a second from another Capoue cross as the Reds looked rattled. Liverpool had to improve in the second half and Fabinho put them back in front on aggregate with a shot that went through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 62nd minute. Luis Diaz, whose introduction at half time changed the game after he replaced Diogo Jota, restored Liverpool's two-goal aggregate advantage with a header at the back post. Sadio Mane secured Liverpool's place in their third Champions League final in five seasons with a third goal after taking the ball around Rulli. Villarreal ended the game with 10 men with Capoue sent off late on for two bookable offences. The Reds will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. No English side has ever won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup all in the same season, with Liverpool aiming to create history. Villarreal's performance in their 2-0 loss at Anfield led one English radio pundit to call the Spanish side a \"disgrace\" and \"pathetic\", despite an incredible run that had seen them eliminate former winners Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds. However, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp knew the tie was not over and warned his side they \"would have to be prepared to suffer\" in the second leg. And suffer they did in arguably Liverpool's worst half of football this season, with passes misplaced, errors made and the side looking uncharacteristically vulnerable. They made the worst possible start, conceding after only three minutes. Pervis Estupinan, who scored an own goal at Anfield, provided a cross which was pulled back by Capoue and Dia, inside the six-yard box, reacted quickest to convert from close range. Dani Parejo shot just wide and Gerard Moreno had an effort blocked before Villarreal, seventh in La Liga and managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, made it 2-2 on aggregate thanks to Coquelin's fine header. Liverpool had to improve in the second half, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot hit the crossbar after taking a huge deflection off Coquelin. But the breakthrough came with Fabinho's strike and that led to a capitulation from Villarreal, who conceded three times in a 12-minute spell. Diaz headed in Alexander-Arnold's cross to give the visitors some breathing space before a rash decision from Rulli saw him sprint off the line with Mane getting there first and finishing into an unguarded goal. This is the 10th time Liverpool have reached the final of the European Cup or Champions League as they aim to become European champions for a seventh time after successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019. Liverpool's progress keeps them on course to become the first English side to complete the quadruple. They already have the Carabao Cup in the trophy cabinet after beating Chelsea on penalties in February and Thomas Tuchel's side are again the opposition at Wembley for the FA Cup final on 14 May. This victory means Liverpool have become the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. Liverpool are also only one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League title race and could meet in the Champions League final later this month. Pep Guardiola's side hold the advantage in the second semi-final after an incredible first leg at Etihad Stadium saw them beat Real 4-3 in one of the best games in the tournament's history. The second leg takes place at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday and if the Spanish champions, managed by ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, can turn the one-goal deficit around it would set up a repeat of the 2018 final. Real won 3-1 on that occasion as Gareth Bale scored twice, including an incredible overhead kick, but the game will largely be remembered for two goalkeeping errors from Liverpool's Loris Karius.

{"title": "Real Madrid v Man City: Luck or genius? Why Carlo Ancelotti is underrated", "content": "370 \"The quality of Madrid is not by chance or luck. They have a high level in everything.\" Was Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola just being polite in the aftermath of the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid? City  won a sensational game 4-3  and take that slender lead to the Bernabeu on Wednesday to meet a side that has since been crowned champions of Spain. Winning La Liga sees Carlo Ancelotti become the  first manager to win the title in Europe's top five leagues  - and should he claim the Champions League, he will become the first to win it four times, moving clear of Liverpool's Bob Paisley and Real's Zinedine Zidane.  But still, the Spanish giants are often accused of winning despite the Italian rather than because of him. What is their gameplan? How many times have individuals bailed them out?  Los Merengues are in the middle of a rebuild and while they may be significantly better managed financially than competitors Barcelona, they still cannot boast squad perfection.  They simply do not have much money to spare. There are stadium renovations to think of and the purchase of PSG striker Kylian Mbappe to fund, not just because of his talent but because his marketing potential will generate another revenue stream.   As such, the squad consists of ageing stars and developing kids but little else in between. Their net spend in the transfer market in the past decade, according to the  Football Observatory , is lower than that of teams such as Leeds, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. In the past two summers, Real have only paid money for one player, Eduardo Camavinga who arrived for £28m from Rennes.  Considering the squad's deficiencies, Real president Florentino Perez was limited in his choices for a coach when he looked for a replacement for Zinedine Zidane in 2021. He needed a pragmatist, someone who made the best of what was already there as the club continued to rebuild.   In came Ancelotti for his second spell. The 62-year-old is a master at working with what he has and in putting the quality of the individual at the forefront of his plans but that wasn't always how he did things.  He trained under the great Arrigo Sacchi and grew up learning the art of a great playing strategy. The system was so important to him that he famously did not want Roberto Baggio or Gianfranco Zola in his side because they did not suit the system. His time at Juventus and training France legend Zidane as well as his ensuing experience made him learn to adapt and he has since become a pragmatist who puts the players first.  Loyalty to the player means putting them in the ideal conditions to express their best. Let's take forwards Vinicius Jr and Karim Benzema as an example. Against Borussia Monchengladbach in last season's Champions League, Benzema was caught on camera accusing Vinicius Jr of \"playing against us\", telling team-mate Ferland Mendy to not pass the youngster the ball. The Brazilian's inability to make the right decision under pressure was noted by many. In December 2020, just a few weeks later, Spanish newspaper Marca asked their experts to explain why Real were not performing, especially in attack. \"There is a lack of a goalscorer to make the difference in matches. Cristiano [Ronaldo]'s departure has been more decisive than many thought,\" said journalist Felipe Del Campo.  Fast forward 13 months from when that report was published and ESPN reminded us in January 2022 that \"Real pair Karim Benzema and Vinicius Junior have outscored the entire Barca squad thus far, having shared 36 goals between themselves as opposed to the 35 goals collectively amassed by the Catalans\". Maybe Ancelotti just hugged them more, made them feel good?  Ancelotti always downplays how much he advises his players but clear data was collected and studied to help Vinicius Jr make better decisions and allow him to form a better partnership with Benzema.  Ballon d'Or and World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro once explained just how vital Ancelotti was to his own development.  \"What I remember the most from Ancelotti is learning zonal marking,\" said the former Real, Juventus and Inter Milan defender. \"I was accustomed to only tracking the man, but with him I learned the right movements and posture.\" As for Benzema, when he missed his first ever penalty for Real in January 2022, Ancelotti absorbed all the criticism and told everyone it was his fault and not his striker's.  Allowing the individuals to shine is one thing but Ancelotti is also one of the finest readers of the game. He never stops working in a match, adjusting and forcing tactical changes that provoke mistakes from opponents while simultaneously putting his players in a better position to exploit.  Against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final, Real suffered deeply in the second leg. They were forced deeper and deeper but kept adjusting to increase the energy in midfield and maintain an attacking threat. The idea was to push Luka Modric closer to the attack and give him more opportunity to find a killer pass by bringing on Rodrygo. A goal was instantly achieved. Against another great pragmatic strategist in Thomas Tuchel, Ancelotti's adjustments and substitutions were key - along with a large slice of luck. In an interview with L'Equipe, France left-back Lucas Digne explained that his former Everton boss Ancelotti \"is the best strategist, he analyses his opponents very well, he reads games very well.  \"In every game he tries to adapt to the players at his disposal. He can vary his system with one snap of his fingers.\" It would be remiss not to note how important it is for Real to have Antonio Pintus back as their fitness coach. How else would such a collection of ageing stars continue to perform at the optimum levels? Ancelotti takes care of their mentality and Pintus ensures perfect physical conditioning.  Make no mistake, Real deserve their La Liga title and to be contending for the Champions League final not only because of luck but because of clever strategies, attention to detail and the ability to convert fine individuals into great competitors.

{"title": "Sevilla 0-4 Man City: Erling Haaland scores twice in comfortable Champions League opening win", "content": "1570 Erling Haaland scored twice as Manchester City opened their Champions League campaign by thrashing a dismal Sevilla side. Haaland's ninth goal in five games set City on their way in Spain, with the Norwegian forward tapping in from Kevin de Bruyne's superb driven cross.  He added to his tally after the break when he was again on hand to score from close range after home goalkeeper Yassine Bounou parried Phil Foden's shot into his path.  In between, England midfielder Foden had given City a healthy cushion in their Group G opener, teasing his marker Nemanja Gudelj before sweeping a left-foot effort into the bottom-right corner of the net.  Ruben Dias underlined the gulf in class between the Premier League champions and the side that finished fourth in La Liga last term late on, side-footing Joao Cancelo's cross into the middle of an empty net.  \"When they were playing better we scored the second one with a brilliant action from Phil [Foden]. Then after it was easier - we gave more passes,\" City manager Pep Guardiola told BT Sport. \"Sometimes we want to rush so quick because Erling is there. You have this attraction of him, we want to attack it sometimes. We have to be more patient. I think his numbers across his career, not just here, is quite similar. \"So he has an incredible sense of goal. We have incredible numbers in scoring goals, so we want to continue like that.\" The manner of City's victory and final scoreline was not unduly flattering, with the visitors dominant throughout. Julen Lopetegui's side looked short of attacking ideas and bereft of confidence after their winless start to the La Liga season.  With John Stones and Kyle Walker missing because of minor injuries Guardiola handed a debut to  Switzerland defender Manuel Akanji , but aside from a wild first-half effort from Alejandro Gomez, the hosts barely threatened.  The comprehensive win sends City top of their group, with Borussia Dortmund second on goal difference after beating FC Copenhagen 3-0 in their opening match. City's only previous trip to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium came almost seven years ago when Wilfried Bony scored in  comfortable 3-1 win .  This performance was even more assured, with Guardiola's side monopolising possession against their hosts who offered little threat to counter.  Predictably Haaland, who is seen by many as the man who can be the  final piece of the jigsaw  as City chase European glory, came to the fore again.  The forward maintained his incredible start to his City career as he knocked in goals 11 and 12 from his eight appearances for the club.  Neither were remarkable, but both owed to his exceptional ability to read the game and anticipate the cross from De Bruyne, as well as Bounou's mistake.  Both his finishes were from no more than eight yards out, again underlining his capacity to operate with clinical efficiency from a limited number of touches (19), and they contributed to City's biggest ever win against Spanish opposition.

{"title": "Does football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?", "content": "1099 Real Madrid's comeback win over Manchester City was one of the  most dramatic games  in Champions League history - but it was not without controversy.  Having forced extra time with Rodrygo's stunning late double before edging ahead in the tie through Karim Benzema's penalty, Real did what most teams would do: they ran down the clock with a masterful exhibition of game management.  However, referee Daniele Orsato had added just three minutes to the second period of extra time, and then blew his whistle with 10 seconds remaining, just when City keeper Ederson was about to boot the ball up the pitch.  While some have eulogised Real after another stunning fightback, others have used the latter stages of the game to debate the rules around the ball being in play.  Writing in the  Daily Mail , former referee Mark Clattenburg suggested football introducing 60-minute matches with a stop-clock to eradicate gamesmanship.  Other sports like basketball and American football use a stop-clock, and it's a straightforward concept: essentially, the clock is stopped whenever the ball is not in play, for incidents including injuries, substitutions and the referee dishing out cautions.  Football's law-making body the International Football Association Board (Ifab) has  previously looked into  the possibility of introducing a stop-clock. In this season's Premier League, the average 'ball in play' time is 55 minutes and three seconds - the lowest it has been in over a decade. BBC Sport - using Opta data - looks at some of the ball in play stats to see how each team performs. This season's ball in play average is the lowest the Premier League has seen since 2010-11.  It's down one minute and 19 seconds from last season, and a minute 40 seconds on the 2013-14 campaign's average.  But there has been less than an hour's play for as long as Opta has been collecting the data. It will hardly be a surprise to learn that the league's best teams have the ball in play more than those who are fighting for their lives at the bottom of the table.  Norwich are something of an outlier, however, placing 11th for 'ball in play' despite having propped up the Premier League table for much of this season.  How much play are you seeing in your club's matches? As seen below, a lot of the same teams pop up in this season's Premier League fixtures with the lowest ball in play time, with Aston Villa, Newcastle and Everton all appearing four times in the table above. The game with the lowest time in play this season - West Ham v Brentford with 41 minutes, 33 seconds - is someway short of Stoke v Blackburn from February 2010, though.  That game - which Stoke won 3-0 in Tony Pulis' 300th game in charge - saw the ball in play for just 39 minutes and one second, 58 seconds fewer than the next game on the list. The ball being out of play was a common theme in games featuring Stoke. The table below has four of their home matches.  The highest was Manchester United's 1-0 home win over Fulham in March 2012 with a whopping 71 minutes and 51 seconds.  That's over half an hour more than Stoke-Blackburn, so you can see how the ball in play times can vary wildly.  But how does the Premier League's ball in play averages compare to other leagues across Europe and the Champions League?  Interestingly, in Spain's La Liga - which Real Madrid have just won - has the highest average game time (97 minutes, 43 seconds) and the lowest percentage of time in play (54.6).

Under the new format, each team will play eight games over 10 match weeks. But a plan to give two Champions League places to individual clubs solely on the basis of their past European performance has been abandoned. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said \"the dream to participate will remain for all clubs\". Instead, two of the four extra places will be awarded on the performance of a country's clubs in Europe over the previous season. As it stands, the Premier League and Dutch Eredivisie would receive an extra place for next season if the rules to be introduced in 2024-25 were in force at present.  Uefa said another place would go to the third-placed league team in the country standing fifth in their rankings - at present, that team joins in the third qualifying round. The European governing body said a fourth place would go to one country's domestic champions by increasing from four to five the number of teams who qualify via the 'Champions Path'. That is Uefa's name for the qualification process for domestic champions who do not automatically go into the group stage. Uefa, though, rejected a proposal to allow clubs into the competition solely on the basis of past performance - something critics argued would have favoured 'bigger' names and provided them with a safety net if they performed poorly in a season. It has also modified an initial plan to increase the number of games in the group phase per team from six to 10 - instead raising the number of matches to eight. \"Uefa has clearly shown today that we are fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport and to defending the key principle of open competitions, with qualification based on sporting merit, fully in line with the values and solidarity-based European sports model,\" said Ceferin. \"We are convinced that the format chosen strikes the right balance and that it will improve the competitive balance and generate solid revenues that can be distributed to clubs, leagues and into grassroots football across our continent while increasing the appeal and popularity of our club competitions.\" Ceferin said the new format had been approved unanimously by Uefa's executive committee, with the agreement of Europe's league bodies and national associations. He added: \"Qualification will thus remain purely based on sporting performance and the dream to participate will remain for all clubs.\"  The current format sees teams divided up into eight groups of four, with teams playing each other home and away over six games. The top two in each group progress to the last 16 when it becomes a knockout tournament, with ties played home and away over two legs, before the final at a neutral venue over one match. The new format will see the initial phase contain one single league table, which includes all teams.  Each club will play eight group-stage games against different opponents, with four home ties and four away.  The top eight will go through to the knockout stage, while those from ninth to 24th will compete in a two-legged play-off to progress. Uefa added that \"similar format changes will also be applied to the Europa League (eight matches in the league stage) and Europa Conference League (six matches in the league stage) and both will also include 36 teams in the league phase\".  The European Club Association (ECA), which represents more than 240 clubs, said it endorses the reforms made by Uefa. It said the changes \"mean that the new-look competitions will have the best start in life, resulting from exhaustive consultations between Uefa and ECA over a number of years that ensure the legitimate interests of all relevant stakeholders are respected - driven by collective rather than self-interest\".  It added: \"The new format also gives the opportunity for future growth of European football in a sustainable, responsible and inclusive way.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61388244"},
{"title": "Liverpool beat Villarreal: How the Reds came back from the brink in Champions League semi-final", "content": "906 For 45 minutes on Tuesday, Liverpool's hopes of reaching the Champions League final looked in serious jeopardy. They were outplayed during the first half of their semi-final second leg in Villarreal, the Reds producing surely their worst half of the season in a game that threatened to derail their quadruple hopes. But - as is so often the case - Jurgen Klopp's side found a way. Liverpool had looked in control of the tie after a comfortable 2-0 win last week at Anfield, but the Spanish side cancelled out that lead by the break. At the hour mark it was still 2-2 on aggregate, but Fabinho, half-time substitute Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane scored to  send Liverpool to Paris  - where they will play either Real Madrid or Manchester City. The turnaround in Villarreal means: Klopp revealed after the game that he asked assistant manager Peter Krawietz at half-time to show a clip of something his players did well during the first half so they could replicate that in the second period - but he could not find one. They trailed 2-0 to goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin and had not had a shot on target themselves. \"The problem at half-time was that we knew what was wrong because it was obvious but we didn't have a situation to show where we did it right,\" Klopp said.  \"I said to Krawietz: 'Find one where we do well and we can show it.' He came in and said: 'Nah, don't have it.'  \"So it was a big half-time but it was about how the boys reacted. We were calm and we are still here. \"We did not play football at all. I told the boys: 'They have momentum but they don't own it, we can get it back.' When we broke the lines and found spaces and were more flexible and not fixed on positions, all of a sudden we were in the game. We scored goals and made it happen. \"What I said was about football, where we had to play, where we had to move, where we had to be brave, change momentum, going in behind and in between. It was a football problem and you solve it with football. \"After three minutes [of the first half] our minds were not right. We were in a rush and felt the pressure. You have to force your own football through and in the second half we did that.\" The Reds had only had three touches in Villarreal's box and completed 36.2% of their passes in the final third of the first half, just a week after a performance so dominant at Anfield that Villarreal's approach was  described as \"pathetic\" by one radio pundit. On Klopp's half-time team talk, Reds defender Virgil van Dijk told BT Sport: \"He told us to play football, the Liverpool way, how we have all season.  \"They play a high line so with the speed we have we needed to mix it up. Also we needed to show how much we wanted to go to the final. In the second half we dominated.\" Right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold added: \"We regrouped at half-time and got the game by the scruff of the neck. We did what we needed to do. \"We never played football in that first half and didn't pick up any second balls. They played the game they wanted to and we allowed them to do that. In the second half, we controlled the game better.\" The introduction of Diaz at half-time was a major turning point. The Colombia forward, who replaced Diogo Jota, scored the Reds' equaliser on the night - the goal that pretty much wrapped up the tie. In 45 minutes he had more shots - four - than anybody else managed in the whole game. His passing accuracy of 90% was better than any Reds player bar late substitute James Milner. \"Diaz made a big difference,\" said BBC Radio 5 Live co-commentator Chris Sutton. \"He's been a revelation. We talk about players needing time to bed in but he's settled in immediately.\" The £37.5m January signing has scored five goals since his move from Porto. Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport: \"Diaz was the difference-maker. He was mesmeric. He's a fabulous player.\" Ex-Reds striker Michael Owen added: \"I've never seen a guy come in and hit the ground running like him. To pick up the way Liverpool play straight away like he has is incredible. And now there is no question about it, he's a starter.\" Liverpool are now only six games from an unprecedented English quadruple - albeit they trail Premier League leaders Manchester City by a point with four games remaining and need their rivals to slip up. Only Celtic, in 1966-67, have ever won a European Cup, league title, cup and league cup in a season - though most countries do not have two domestic cups. Since Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool in 2017 they have won three trophies - the 2018-19 Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League and this season's Carabao Cup. They had only won three trophies in the 13 years before his arrival. The Egyptian, who is the Reds' top scorer this season on 30 goals, said: \"We fight for everything. We win one trophy, now we are in another final. We keep fighting in the Premier League.  \"The quadruple is the target now. Maybe not at the start of the season. I am always honest and focus on the Champions League and Premier League. But now, why not? After we beat City in the FA Cup semi-final [I thought it was on]. \"After the group stage I thought, 'OK, we are going to win the Champions League this year'. \"I want to play Madrid [in the final]. City is a really tough team.\" Klopp added: \"It's really difficult to reach three finals, that's probably why nobody has done it before.  \"When the finals show up in the schedule we will make sure we're ready for it, but we play incredibly strong teams in these finals, so we will give it a go but it's difficult.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61311907"},
{"title": "How Erling Haaland will add a new dimension to Man City's play - Micah Richards analysis", "content": "My first reaction when I heard that Manchester City had agreed to sign Erling Haaland was just 'wow!' What a brilliant bit of business to strike a deal now, and what an unbelievable signing he will be. I don't want to say he is the missing piece in their team, because City have been excellent for the past couple of seasons anyway while mostly doing without a recognised striker, but he will add a whole new dimension to their play. I remember when City beat Borussia Dortmund last season, Haaland was roughing up Ruben Dias and I'd never seen anyone do that to him before. Haaland will put pressure on defenders in a way none of City's current forwards do, plus offer more of a threat from crosses and also hold it up and bring other people into play.  Oh, and of course he will score goals - loads and loads of goals.  Every time I watch him, his finishing is just ridiculously good. I still think City miss too many chances, but that won't happen very often when they fall to Haaland. His numbers aren't only great in the Bundesliga, either - they are just as impressive in the Champions League. All this, and by activating his 60m euros (£51.2m) buyout clause, they haven't even had to break the bank to bring the Norway international to Etihad Stadium. It will be an amazing deal - he is about half the price of Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who City tried to buy last summer and, at 21, is seven years younger.  They are going to get twice as long out of Haaland, at least. It's amazing news for City fans but scary for everyone else, because it is just frightening to think how good he could turn out to be. Haaland's dad, Alf-Inge, played for City too -  he joined from Leeds in June 2000,  a few weeks before Erling was born - so it was obviously time for him to come home! Being serious, though, by getting Haaland this summer, City will have won the race for a global superstar who all the biggest clubs in the world have been chasing for the past couple of years. For all the exciting and, yes, expensive signings that City have made in the past decade or so, there have not been too many what I would call blockbuster buys like this one, that make everyone else across Europe sit up and take notice. They had to do this deal, though. It might not be City's ethos to always go after the very biggest marquee names, but this time they just had to be at the table. Firstly, it's not that often that these kind of players become available, especially at such a good price, but Haaland's age is a big factor here too. As much as City want success now - and remember they can still win the Premier League this season - the great thing is they always have an eye on the future as well. City are always thinking about how they can be dominating for years to come and Haaland obviously fits the bill there. Other than Paris St-Germain's Kylian Mbappe, there is no better striker out there aged 23 or younger. So, it will be money well spent for me, and it is also a massive statement to all their rivals. City are basically saying 'yes we have had stacks of recent success, but we are not stopping here'. It also sends out a message to everyone already at the club that they are here to win trophies. No-one is guaranteed them of course - but City are guaranteed to compete for them, and that is all a player wants. That's the reason Haaland will sign. It's also why players like Kane wanted to come to City - and why so few players seem to want to leave. Sergio Aguero spent 10 years at City when he could have gone to any club in the world. It wouldn't surprise me if Haaland did the same because it's that kind of environment, and it's the same for the manager too.  Pep Guardiola is out of contract in 2023 and, although there will be plenty of other things that influence his decision whether to sign a new deal, adding another huge talent for him to work with to what was already such an exciting young squad is hardly going to harm City's chances of keeping him. I find it annoying that, whichever player you talk about and no matter how good they are, someone will always bring up what he can't do.  With Haaland, I'd already been hearing how he won't press like the rest of the team do when City play with a false nine. Yes, they might lose a little bit of that with him in the side but you are going to get so much more in terms of how clinical he is and his sharpness and movement inside the opposition box. Besides, City have so much of the ball - they have averaged more than 68% possession in Premier League games this season - and win the ball back so high up the pitch that Haaland won't even have to press that much. Instead, we are talking about him making dashes of five metres or 10 metres in areas where he already is, so it is not as if he will be dropping deep to the halfway line and then being asked to cover the width of the pitch. So, I just don't buy any argument that he would not fit into City's style of play - it actually suits him, with his bursts of energy. He is lightning quick and he works hard anyway. There are bound to be comparisons made to, say, Kane, because City tried and failed to sign him last summer. But, given the choice of who to get, I'd go for Haaland every time. Kane is a brilliant player and would 100% make City's team better too, but his age and his injury record count against him when you consider his price, and made him more of a risk.  I can understand why Haaland is viewed as a risk too, because he has never played in the Premier League, but watch him play in the Champions League and Bundesliga and you will not be worried about that one bit. He is not just one for the future, he is ready made for the big stage now.  Of course he can get even better still - like Aguero did, he can keep working on what he does off the ball and his work outside the area, but his link-up play is already improving anyway. He is young enough to adapt his game, and who better to learn that from than Guardiola? It all adds up to make him the perfect signing - put Haaland in this City side and he will definitely flourish. There is lots to look forward to before that happens, but I can't wait to see him in a sky blue shirt.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60840447"},
{"title": "Real Madrid 3-1 Manchester City (6-5 agg): Real come back to reach Champions League final", "content": "6736 Manchester City suffered one of the most remarkable Champions League collapses as Real Madrid came back from the abyss to set up a final showdown with Liverpool. City were two goals ahead on aggregate going into the 90th minute after Riyad Mahrez's strike had added to their 4-3 first-leg win last week. And then Rodrygo happened. The Brazilian substitute turned home Karim Benzema's left-wing ball from close range in the final minute - with Real's very first shot on target. And 90 seconds later he levelled the tie with a header into the top corner after Marco Asensio flicked on Dani Carvajal's cross. That sent an already rowdy Bernabeu into absolute euphoria. City, who thought they were going through to a second consecutive all-English Champions League final, were shell-shocked. Both sides had chances to win the tie before the full-time whistle. Ederson denied Rodrygo a quick-fire hat-trick and then an unmarked Phil Foden fired over inside the box. And so to extra time the game went - and it was Real who got the decisive goal in maybe the greatest Champions League semi-final ever. Benzema beat Ruben Dias to a loose ball in the box and was brought down by the City defender. He stepped up to take the penalty himself and scored his 43rd goal of the season. There is no doubt it is the most important. Real's Thibaut Courtois, who was by far the busier keeper, tipped away Foden's header with Fernandinho inches away from scoring the rebound - but City could not find a goal to send it to penalties. That sets up a repeat of the most memorable Champions League final of recent years, when Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in 2018. For City and manager Pep Guardiola now, the Premier League title - they sit one point above Liverpool with four games to go - is their only target. The Champions League has delivered so many classic knockout ties in recent years, including the first leg of this one - a match City should have won by more. It was looking like a rare, and delightfully, mundane one for City after Mahrez hammered home following Bernardo Silva's surging run. City have five Premier League titles - and are four wins away from a sixth - since the Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008. But the Champions League - the trophy that really establishes your place as an icon of world football - has always eluded them. After last season's 1-0 loss to Chelsea in Porto, they may have wondered how long they would have to wait for another crack.  It looked like the answer was only 12 months. But now, who knows?  City fans will curse Rodrygo's name forever if they never manage to win the European Cup. The truth is City should have won this game easily. In the first half, Real keeper Courtois denied Mahrez, Kevin de Bruyne, Silva and Foden. Late on Jack Grealish had a shot cleared off the line by Ferland Mendy - and another effort kept out by a diving Courtois.  Ederson's only save in normal time came to deny Rodrygo a hat-trick. After Benzema's goal, they rarely looked like coming back and their players stood emotionless as the final whistle went on their European dreams. Now Guardiola has a huge task on his hands. He has to lift City's players' heads for their final four Premier League games.  If they lose any of them, that gives Liverpool the chance to overtake them and win the title - and possibly become the first English team to win the quadruple. Real are the ultimate European Cup team, having won the competition 13 times - six times more than anybody else. But in the final minute not even they could have imagined they would be going to Paris later this month. So many times this season they were on the brink. They came back from 2-0 down on aggregate to beat Paris St-Germain in the last 16. Then in the quarter-final against Chelsea, Rodrygo sent it to extra time with a late goal and Benzema netted the winner. Sound familiar? Rodrygo, who replaced Toni Kroos after 68 minutes here, has truly booked his place in Real folklore now. Carlo Ancelotti's side wrapped up the La Liga title last weekend and can now focus all their attention on that game with Liverpool. Their last final meeting, in 2018 in Kyiv, saw Gareth Bale score twice and Loris Karius' howler gift Benzema a goal in a classic. Rodrygo is the third substitute to score multiple goals for Real Madrid in a Champions League match. Bale that day was one of the other two.

{"title": "Luka Modric: Real Madrid's Croatian midfield maestro still magnificent at 36", "content": "It's not difficult to pinpoint the biggest threat to Manchester City's chances of advancing to the Champions League final. Karim Benzema is having a spectacular season for Real Madrid, with consecutive hat-tricks against Paris St-Germain and Chelsea suggesting the 34-year-old France striker is ready to inherit the 'Mr Champions League' mantle from former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. But Benzema is not Real's only 30-something star who keeps getting better with age, because midfield maestro Luka Modric - now 36 - is also having another magnificent campaign. In fact, a case could be made that Modric is even more important to Real's overall structure than Benzema, because his dual ability to build play from the back and create danger around the opposition penalty area is fundamental to the team's coherence and fluidity. The Croat has certainly made a major mark on this season's Champions League,  delivering a glorious assist to Rodrygo  with the outside of his right foot to force extra time in the quarter-final second leg against Chelsea. That moment of magic was dubbed the \"pass of the decade\" by former Rangers striker Ally McCoist, while fellow pundit Rio Ferdinand declared it should be \"illegal\". Spanish sports newspaper Marca wrote: \"With Modric on the pitch, nothing is impossible. Build him a statue now!\"  Real president Florentino Perez is another to have sung his praises, saying Modric should be considered for another Ballon d'Or after shining against Athletic Bilbao in January's Spanish Super Cup final. Part of what lies behind the long list of tributes to Modric is a sense that it simply shouldn't be possible for him to consistently perform so brilliantly at the age of 36. That sense of incredulity at his physical condition came up again when he was filmed celebrating in the dressing room after last month's comeback victory over PSG, still apparently full of energy despite covering more ground (10.54km) than any other Real player. The midfielder's age is even a joking matter within the squad: Modric is only a year younger than winger Rodrygo's father, a former professional player in his native Brazil, and the pair have jokingly adopted the respective nicknames 'son' and 'dad' for each other, with Rodrygo even wishing his team-mate a happy Father's Day on social media last month. At the end of last season,  sports paper AS described Modric as \"Benjamin Button\"  - in reference to the Brad Pitt movie about a man who ages in reverse - after noting with disbelief that he had made 57 appearances for Real and Croatia over the course of the campaign, completing the full 90 minutes in 33 of them. And he hasn't slowed down since then, playing 44 games so far this season to make the idea that he could keep on playing into his 40s - as suggested in  a recent interview with AS by Vlatko Vucetic,  a Croatian fitness specialist who works closely with Modric - appear not quite so ridiculous.  However much longer he keeps on going, though, Modric's position in Real Madrid's history books is already assured. After joining from Tottenham in 2012, his first season was relatively disappointing as Jose Mourinho's reign imploded.  But Carlo Ancelotti's (first) arrival at Real in 2013 saw Modric immediately become a key player, and he concluded that campaign by contributing to one of the most famous moments in club history: delivering a pinpoint corner for Sergio Ramos' injury-time equaliser to pave the way for a 4-1 Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid, the club's 10th in the competition. Ever since then, Modric has been an indispensable member of the Blancos' midfield, winning three more Champions Leagues and taking the Ballon d'Or after the most recent of those triumphs in 2018, the same year he inspired Croatia's run to the World Cup final. It has certainly helped that the majority of his time in Spain has been spent as one-third of an exceptional trio alongside Toni Kroos and Casemiro, who have made a staggering combined total of 1,114 appearances in the famous white shirt (Modric 429, Kroos 357, Casemiro 328) to undoubtedly become one of the best central units of all time. They have been so successful together because they complement each other perfectly: Casemiro's powerful defensive instincts, Kroos' metronomic passing and Modric's energy and guile provide everything a midfield could need. Modric, however, is the one who has produced the regular magical moments of creative brilliance to really stand out, and he now probably has only Zinedine Zidane - whose playing career at the Bernabeu was much shorter - as a serious rival for the status as the club's best-ever midfielder. And the past few months have made it clear that he is nowhere near finished yet. To flip the old axiom about emerging teen talents, if you're good enough, you're young enough. And Modric, who made his professional debut when City's Phil Foden was three years old, is still one of the very best.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61211531"},

{"title": "Atletico Madrid 0-0 Man City (agg: 0-1): Mature City hold off Atletico in fiery encounter to reach semis", "content": "2275 Manchester City produced a mature and disciplined performance to hold off the challenge of Atletico Madrid - and set up a Champions League semi-final showdown with the Spanish side's city rivals Real. Knowing a clean sheet would be enough to seal the tie, City kept their cool in the face of a hostile home crowd and intimidation from a physical Atleti side showing far more ambition than in the first leg. Ilkay Gundogan could have made life much easier for Pep Guardiola's men by slotting in from close range, instead of against the post in the first half. But in the face of much-increased pressure and a home side pushing desperately for parity, City put up a resolute rearguard action to confirm their progression to the last four. Atletico ended the fiery contest with 10 men when defender Felipe was shown a second yellow card for a dangerous follow-through on Phil Foden, having also caught the same player with an arm that drew blood from the England international's head earlier in the game. Real Madrid, who edged past Chelsea in a thrilling quarter-final tie on Tuesday, now stand between City and a second successive appearance in the final of Europe's premier club competition. Having lost to Thomas Tuchel's Blues in last season's final, Guardiola's side are seeking a maiden Champions League title in a campaign where they are still challenging on three fronts. They lead the Premier League by one point from second-placed Liverpool - and face Jurgen Klopp's Reds in an FA Cup semi-final this Saturday. City have grown accustomed to controlling games of football at this level, strangling the life out of teams through sheer volume of possession before surgically picking them off in what are often benign, one-sided encounters. For 45 minutes here, though, they were given a taste of their own medicine and forced to dig deep against extreme pressure from an increasingly desperate opponent, whose ill-discipline in stoppage time should could easily have resulted in further red cards. It is a huge feather in City's cap that they were able to hold firm against repeated attacks and then keep their heads as Atletico were losing theirs. It is a shame that the credit the home side's attacking display deserved was largely overshadowed by their unnecessary antics. They included a potential headbutt from former City centre-back Stefan Savic on Raheem Sterling - and hair pull on Jack Grealish - during an unsavoury melee involving both sets of players and the two benches after Felipe's foul on Foden. Clashes also continued at full-time as both sets of players made their way down the tunnel. Prior to this, the 90 minutes had showcased a different approach from the Spanish champions in comparison to a first leg in which they operated largely in a 5-5-0 formation and failed to muster a single effort on goal. Roared on by a vociferous home crowd, they pressed fiercely, harrying the City players all over the pitch. Having stayed in the tie for three quarters of it - with Geoffrey Kondogbia's blocked 35th-minute effort their solitary shot across both legs - the hosts came out swinging for the second period. Antoine Griezmann went close, as did Rodrigo de Paul, Matheus Cunha and Luis Suarez, as boss Diego Simeone threw every attacking option he had onto the field in the hope of breaking the visitors down. But this is not an easily intimidated City side, nor does their elite attacking prowess come at the expense of defensive frailty, even when injury affected Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker and forced the introduction of Nathan Ake. John Stones was immense, with a block to deny a Cunha effort from close range the highlight of an intelligent and dogged display. Keeper Ederson was also called upon for a heroic moment, saving superbly to stop Angel Correa's shot after the ball had broken to the Atletico man in the box in the 11th minute of added time. Celebrations were mixed among the confrontations at full-time, but City have little time to rest after this epic energy-sapping encounter. Saturday sees them face Liverpool in the FA Cup semi and, two weeks from now, Real will visit the Etihad.

Step up in a Champions League semi-final and score a Panenka, that's what. At least, that's what Karim Benzema did anyway. The Real Madrid striker showed nerves of steel as he dinked his spot-kick over Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson to make it 4-3 in their exhilarating first-leg defeat at Etihad Stadium.  The nonchalance summed up a sensational match between two of Europe's heavyweights that showcased relentless attacking football throughout. Former England defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport: \"Ice cold, this guy. He has won four Champions League trophies. Even if it was in the last minute, he would've still executed it.\" Six days earlier Benzema  missed two penalties  in Real Madrid's win over Osasuna - but he netted his ninth goal in his last four Champions League games on Tuesday night. \"I always have it in my head that if you don't take a penalty, you will never miss a penalty,\" said Benzema.  \"That's mental confidence, that's all. I have a lot of confidence in myself so I do it and it turns out well. \"Now we have to go to the Bernabeu [for the second leg] and we will need our fans like never before and we are going to do something magical, which is win.\" Ex-England striker Alan Shearer laughed on BBC Radio 5 Live commentary as he watched Benzema's penalty go in. \"All I can do is chuckle and think, 'I cannot believe Karim Benzema has just done that.' The sheer arrogance of it but also the belief and the ability to do that,\" said Shearer. \"He seems to be getting better and better. The audacity! It was incredible.\" It was a frantic game at Etihad Stadium as City went 2-0 up within 11 minutes and missed several huge chances before Benzema got one back for Real before half-time. City's Phil Foden and Real's Vinicius Junior scored in quick succession as the visitors kept fighting back, before Bernardo Silva fired the hosts 4-2 up. Benzema's late penalty ensured Real go into the second leg with just a one-goal deficit and manager Carlo Ancelotti believes the striker changed it up after missing two spot-kicks last week. \"I think he changed because the last two penalties were not good. He changed and tried it in training. I did not know how he would shoot,\" said Ancelotti. \"He choose this and it goes really well. He has a strong personality and character. It is not easy in the semi-final of the Champions League to do a penalty like this.\" Former Real Madrid and City winger Steve McManaman told BT Sport Benzema would have been in trouble if he had missed. \"He missed two in his last game against Osasuna and he must've thought that Ederson would've been studying where he was trying to put the ball.  \"He hasn't done a Panenka so instead of going left or right he must've thought 'now is the time'. They were 4-2 down at the time so he knows he would be criticised to the hilt [if he misses].\" Benzema is now up to 41 goals in all competitions this season, including 14 in the Champions League.  \"Let's hope he can end the season well, winning the league, the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or,\" said team-mate Vinicius.

{"title": "Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Classic Champions League tie a genuine gold standard match", "content": "1026 Carlo Ancelotti's last visit to Manchester City ended in a 5-0 humiliation in what proved to be the final match of his tenure as Everton manager.  When the legendary Italian manager, 62, turned to his Real Madrid backroom staff with arms outstretched and gave an anxious glance down at his watch with City 2-0 up after only 11 minutes on his return to Etihad Stadium, he was probably fearing a similar scoreline. City were flying. Real were overwhelmed. This was shaping up as a one-sided mauling for the great old Champions League campaigner chasing the trophy for a historic fourth time.  And yet, to the disbelief of pretty much everyone who witnessed a gold standard classic of a football match, Ancelotti was pitchside after the game smiling, eyebrow raised in trademark fashion suggesting he was rather happy to  come away with a 4-3 first leg loss. He did not look as mystified as others at the fact that Real were still in with a shout of reaching yet another Champions League Final. City's players were not exactly deflated - how could they be after such a brilliant performance and a semi-final first leg win? However, their body language gave away the brutal fact that they should have had this tie all wrapped up heading into the second leg in the Bernabeu. This was a breathless night, everything that is good about football at this rarified level and City were, at times, magical.  And yet... The Bernabeu does strange things in the Champions League and, while City are unlikely to endure the same physical onslaught Atletico Madrid subjected them to in the quarter-final second leg, they will face a severe test with just a one-goal lead. City let Real off the hook and history tells us this can be a very expensive mistake.  Ancelotti, as well as many of this Real squad, have been over this course and distance before though they will also know they were ripped to shreds for long periods of this game.  But they will also have serious belief they can go through to face either Liverpool or Villarreal in Paris.  The good news for City is that, despite the narrow scoreline, there were times when they outclassed Real, with Luka Modric unable to exert his usual influence in midfield.  City were quicker, slicker, better, more threatening. This is the knowledge they will pack with them on the flight to Madrid.  And yet... Who knows what sort of lead it takes to finish Real off, backed by the Bernabeu crowd and such a rich history in this competition? Every big night in the grand old arena is accompanied by sense of destiny.  A glimpse of Guardiola's mindset came with City two goals up and Real pretty much floored. The Spaniard flew into a full-on rage in his technical area when Riyad Mahrez committed the cardinal sin in this manager's book by being too greedy, lashing a shot into the side-netting with Phil Foden waiting unattended in the middle and the goal at his mercy. At 3-0 it could have been job done. \"Riyad. Riyad\", Guardiola shouted before continuing the fume. He knows you simply cannot give Real a break and the Spanish giants proved that.  City had a two-goal advantage on three occasions, played wonderful, fluent football but will know there should be no need of those nagging doubts that might have been felt at the final whistle.

City delivered a magnificent display as they peppered Real's goal for long periods but Carlo Ancelotti's side kept rising off the canvas to somehow keep themselves in serious contention to reach another final.  Kevin de Bruyne set the tone for a magical night of football with a diving header from Riyad Mahrez's cross in the second minute and in-form Gabriel Jesus quickly added a second from close range as Real reeled under wave after wave of attacks.  Mahrez enraged manager Pep Guardiola when he hit the side-netting instead of finding the unmarked Phil Foden, who shot inches wide before Karim Benzema, inevitably, gave Real a lifeline by sweeping home Ferland Mendy's cross after 33 minutes.  The Spanish side escaped again shortly after the break when Mahrez struck the post but City restored their two-goal advantage when an unmarked Foden headed home Fernandinho's cross in the 53rd minute.  City were pegged back again when Vinicius Junior dummied past Fernandinho and ran from inside his own half to score a superb second for Real. However, a brilliant use of advantage from referee Istvan Kovacs allowed Bernardo Silva to fire into the top-left corner for City's fourth.  There was still no let-up and Benzema capped a spectacular game by showing nerves of steel to chip a Panenka penalty past Ederson with eight minutes left following Aymeric Laporte's handball.  Liverpool face Spanish side Villarreal  in this year's other semi-final, with the first leg at Anfield on Wednesday. The final will be held at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. City would have taken any sort of advantage to Spain before kick-off but deep down they will know their almost total dominance of Real should have given them much more than this narrow lead for the second leg.  Guardiola's side were simply irresistible for spells and could have been four goals ahead before Benzema struck Real's first, the manager clearly infuriated by Mahrez's selfishness in shooting with Foden standing unmarked in front of goal at 2-0.  Guardiola and his players will take heart from the manner in which they carved Real open so often and they will hope to capitalise on their opponents' need to press for a goal in Spain.  De Bruyne was outstanding once more and Foden just showed how at home he is on the elite stage, but City have to be concerned at how they looked defensively vulnerable on occasion to leave Real very much alive in this semi-final.  A side of City's calibre will be confident of progress - but most observers will know this tie should already be over.  Real will always have hope when they have Benzema, the 34-year-old Frenchman who deserves his place in the upper echelons of the great strikers in world football.  It is often a mystery how Real survive when looking punch drunk having come back from losing situations to beat Paris St-Germain and Chelsea in their previous knockout ties. But a comeback looked beyond them when they were blown away by a blistering City opening that left them two down after only 11 minutes.  And yet, for all their struggles elsewhere, the La Liga leaders carry an air of menace that means concentration levels cannot drop for a moment. They proved it again as they dusted themselves down to give themselves a lifeline.  It was no surprise that Benzema was the man responsible, showing all of his class with a left-foot volley past Ederson to make it 2-1.  Brazilian youngster Vinicius Junior also produced magic for the second goal before Benzema's nerveless penalty.  The great survivors are still in this tie and will now hope the magic of the Bernabeu can inspire them once more next week under coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is trying to win the trophy for a fourth time.

Having established a 3-1 lead in Lisbon, Liverpool extended their advantage with Ibrahima Konate's powerful 21st-minute header from a Kostas Tsimikas corner. Benfica equalised through Goncalo Ramos' excellent turn and finish, before Roberto Firmino's two second-half goals - a tap-in followed by a volley - in front of the Kop looked to have put the Reds in control. But after Roman Yaremchuk broke through to beat Alisson and make it 3-2 on the night, Darwin Nunez scored a late equaliser. Nunez was then denied by Alisson as Benfica finished strongly but Liverpool held out to advance 6-4 on aggregate. They now host Villarreal - the club they beat in the semi-finals of the Europa League in 2016 - on 27 April before travelling to Spain for the second leg on 4 May. Villarreal secured their last-four spot by  overcoming Bayern Munich  in the quarter-finals.  Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: \"I'm really happy because being in a semi-final is so special. \"We expect a couple of really difficult games. It will be a tough cookie but we are a tough cookie, so who cares? \"Villarreal deserved to get through. I know Bayern Munich don't want to hear that.\" The semi-final brings Liverpool face-to-face with Villarreal boss Unai Emery, who has won the Europa League four times. Three of those triumphs came at Sevilla, including victory over Klopp's Liverpool in the 2016 final, and the other with his current club. Klopp added: \"The manager is the king of the cup competitions, so they are experienced and a team full of desire and well organised with top-class players.\" The games are coming thick and fast for Liverpool at the business end of the campaign, with a huge FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City up next on Saturday - the second meeting between the Premier League's top two in a week. They head for Wembley knowing they are one round away from a third Champions League final in five seasons under Klopp. The Liverpool boss made seven changes to the side that started the first leg in Portugal last week, with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane among those on the bench. There was a return for James Milner who, at the age of 36, became the oldest Englishman to start a Champions League match since 37-year-old David Beckham did so for Paris St-Germain in 2012-13. The Reds were made to work hard for their place in the semi-finals as Benfica came out fighting but the damage was done in the first leg. \"I made seven changes and that makes life not easy for the players,\" added Klopp. \"We lost concentration when we were 3-1 up and it looked like we were through. \"It was not exactly what we wanted but it is absolutely not important. \"If we played the best game of the season tonight, it wouldn't have made it more likely to get to the final. We are through and that's all that matters and I'm really happy.\" After Saturday, Liverpool - who trail leaders Manchester City by a single point - have a chance to return to the top of the Premier League, for 24 hours at least, when they host Manchester United in the Premier League the following Tuesday. It will require a monumental effort for Liverpool, who won the Carabao Cup in February, to finish the season with four trophies and they will certainly have to defend better than they did in this game. But with just a few weeks of the season left, they remain in the hunt for what would be an incredible feat.

{"title": "Champions League: 'Man City & Liverpool two of modern era's greatest sides'", "content": "The Spanish duo of Real Madrid and Villarreal will demand a significant say in this matter, but the notion of a Champions League final between Liverpool and Manchester City in Paris is a truly mouthwatering prospect.  And, after the semi-final first legs, the two Premier League thoroughbreds who are conducting their argument on another level will both feel confident they can make what might be a defining date at the Stade de France on 28 May.  Liverpool hold a 2-0 lead over Villarreal after a  controlled display of power at Anfield  while Manchester City take a more hazardous  4-3 advantage over Real Madrid  to the Bernabeu.  They were semi-finals of contrasts but both provided perfect illustrations of why the Premier League is lucky to boast two of the greatest sides of the modern era.  Liverpool, for 53 minutes at least, did not have it easy against Villarreal and their European specialist coach Unai Emery, banging their heads against a yellow wall of defiance until Jordan Henderson's cross took a fortunate deflection off Pervis Estupinan.  It was all this ruthless Liverpool side needed and two minutes later Sadio Mane poked home a second to give them what, logic suggests, will be a decisive advantage.  Liverpool looked in the mood to rub out any hope Villarreal might have had but instead chose to exert iron control, refusing to give up any opportunity to hand Emery's side a lifeline they did not merit in this game.  Manchester City are dealing with much greater jeopardy against Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid, who achieved the quite remarkable feat of being totally outclassed for long periods at Etihad Stadium but still somehow doing enough to have a huge chance of reaching yet another Champions League final.  Liverpool were cool while City were gloriously chaotic, a flawed beauty, ignoring the option of containment to keep pouring forward - and it is these two differing styles that make their rivalry so glorious.  Whatever the evidence of these two games, the two sides are united by the common quality of greatness.  Manchester City hold a narrow lead in the Premier League with Liverpool only one point behind while Klopp's side have the confidence of winning the 2019 Champions League, the trophy that has proved so elusive for City manager Pep Guardiola since he came to England.  City will see Champions League success, especially after the pain of last season's final defeat by another Premier League rival in Chelsea, as affirmation of their status among Europe's elite. Liverpool would regard a seventh triumph as further confirmation of their standing among what their fans call \"European royalty\".  There is still much to be done but European club football's biggest occasion would be a fitting stage for the latest episode in a storyline that looks like it will run for several years.  It was noticeable that Liverpool manager Klopp steered well clear of his trademark fist pumps in front of the Kop at the conclusion of what was ultimately a comfortable win. It is, as the saying goes, only half-time and he was not going to do anything that might suggest premature celebration.  Villarreal's record in disposing of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds will act as a shield against any Liverpool complacency, not that it appears to exist in this team. The way Emery's side were stopped from launching the devastating counter-attacks that have marked their Champions League progress suggest it will take a superhuman feat on their part to come through this to reach the final.  Emery's body language towards the end spoke of a coach who was happy taking a 2-0 defeat, an attitude perhaps shaped by the fear of a heavier beating after Liverpool's one-two pierced their resistance.  In seven days we will know. Champions League combat will resume after the latest round of Premier League fine margins as Liverpool travel to in-form Newcastle United and City face a test at Leeds United.  Liverpool will feel confident of progress at the Estadio de la Ceramica whereas City face the more imposing surroundings of the Bernabeu.  Guardiola must hope Manchester City have not left the door too ajar for Real Madrid, who are adept at squeezing through the smallest spaces in the Champions League, a competition in which they and their legendary coach Ancelotti - looking for his fourth win - believe they are driven by destiny.

{"title": "Liverpool have chance to become 'immortal' after Villarreal win", "content": "\"It's impossible... but now you're thinking, can it happen?\" Liverpool moved to within eight games of \"immortality\" in the shape of an unprecedented English quadruple after  beating Villarreal 2-0  in the Champions League semi-final first leg. The only negative for the Reds was that they should have won by more in a completely convincing performance. Their goals came in quick succession through a Pervis Estupinan own goal and Sadio Mane. The winners will face either Liverpool's Premier League title rivals Manchester City or La Liga champions-elect Real Madrid in the final.  So can the Reds really win all four trophies, what did boss Jurgen Klopp make of the win and do Villarreal have a chance at home next week? Manchester United, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, Ajax and PSV have all won the treble of European Cup, league title and domestic cup. Celtic's  'Lisbon Lions'  went one further, also winning their league cup in 1967 - the only team to have completed a quadruple. But Liverpool - who have already won the Carabao Cup - are in the running to become the first English side to achieve this feat. \"That's got to be the aim,\" said former England defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport. \"They are going to set themselves the target. If they achieve it, they're immortal, they are above anyone that has played the game in this country.  \"Whether they can achieve it remains to be seen. But they're ticking boxes along the way at the moment.\" Liverpool, who face Chelsea in the FA Cup final, need Manchester City to slip up in the Premier League. The Reds trail City by one point with five games to go. Ex-Reds defender Jose Enrique said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"They can win all four trophies. It is nearly impossible but they have that 1% chance.  \"You have to look game by game and I really believe they can do it. I have never seen a Liverpool squad like this - the players look like they believe as well.\" Ex-England international Karen Carney added: \"There was a period of 10 minutes in the second half where they just turned it on and that's the sign of a fantastic team, they sense the moment and take it.  \"That's why they're in the hunt for four trophies because they are experienced enough to know when to do it.\" BBC senior football reporter Ian Dennis said: \"Liverpool have got eight games in 31 days and every single of them is a cup final. They stand on the verge of greatness.\" Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen, speaking on BT, said: \"Imagine it [the quadruple]. It's impossible... but now you're thinking can it happen?\" Liverpool boss Klopp said: \"It was a brilliant game. I liked the first half a lot. We didn't score, that is the only problem.  \"In the second half we finished the situations off in a superb way. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third but from that moment on it makes sense that we control the game and that is what we did. \"In football it is always the same. You show the respect to the opponent in the way that you defend them.\" Liverpool have scored 135 goals in all competitions this season. Their only defeat in 2022 was in the second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie with Inter Milan. Ferdinand said: \"This is the best Liverpool team I've ever seen. They're relentless with and without the ball. It's the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application, you marvel at it.\" Former Liverpool striker Peter Crouch, also on BT, said: \"I was too young for the [great Liverpool] teams of the 70s. This is the best I've seen.  \"Liverpool are kicking on again. They're making subs very well. This is a Champions League semi-final and they're making subs like they're resting players.  \"From where they were [a few years ago] to where they are now is chalk and cheese. It should be a blueprint for other clubs behind like Tottenham, Arsenal, Manchester United.\" The Reds won the English title in 2019-20 after a 30-year wait, having previously gone close in 2013-14. Owen said: \"We should give credit to [former Liverpool manager] Brendan Rodgers. I didn't think I'd ever see a trio like Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez up front. Oh my word it was unbelievable and now a new set of attackers have taken it on again.  \"It's dreamland for Liverpool fans. The last 10 years have been a dream. It's Liverpool's turn in the cycle. It's just how many they can collect while it's their turn. Inevitably other teams will come back.\" \"Villarreal have just got a pulse,\" said Owen. \"If Liverpool had nicked another one it would have been game, set, match.  \"If Villarreal get an early goal in Spain you never know.\" Only twice have a team lost the first leg of a European Cup semi-final 2-0 and gone through - Hamburg against Real Madrid in 1979-80 and Roma against Dundee United in 1983-84. The Reds have never gone out after winning a first leg 2-0 at home in Europe. But they have conceded at least three goals in the away leg of each of their last three Champions League semi-finals. Villarreal boss Unai Emery has said his team will play differently next week, having only had one shot - a joint record low for a Champions League semi-final. He said: \"It's not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. \"The match next week will be very different than tonight. It is very important in our home to change something, maybe tactically. They are going to suffer more than tonight.\" Klopp said: \"We didn't go to Roma thinking we were through [after winning the first leg 5-2 in 2018].  \"For me it's the best example of 2-0 at half-time. You have to be alert and play the second like the first.  \"It will be a tricky atmosphere for us. They will fight with all they have.

{"title": "Carlo Ancelotti: Real Madrid manager on brink of history – so why is his job on line?", "content": "His team are 12 points clear at the top of La Liga and preparing for a Champions League quarter-final with Chelsea, so why is Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti apparently still in serious danger of being fired? To understand the Italian's precarious position, it's necessary to consider the context of his arrival at the club last summer. Real were in a fair amount of turmoil, with a trophy-less season followed by the departure of iconic boss Zinedine Zidane along with captain Sergio Ramos and his central defensive partner Raphael Varane. At such a precarious time in terms of morale, club president Florentino Perez needed a safe pair of hands, someone to lead the short-term task of calmly guiding the team out of choppy waters.  A sense of stability and continuity was required and nobody fitted the bill better than Ancelotti, whose experience and easy-going manner made him the perfect candidate to restore order. He has unquestionably achieved that aim. Real have taken advantage of an inconsistent season from reigning champions Atletico Madrid, a dreadful start from Barcelona and a lack of firepower at Sevilla to establish a surely impregnable position at the top of La Liga - meaning that Ancelotti is poised to become the first manager in history to win the title in each of Europe's big five leagues. Whether Ancelotti - who will be at Stamford Bridge after testing negative for Covid on Wednesday - will be given the opportunity to defend the crown next season, however, is a different matter. Real's results over the course of the campaign have largely been better than their performances, with the team often over-reliant on Karim Benzema for attacking inspiration and Thibaut Courtois for goalkeeping heroics. The absence of the former was particularly notable a couple of weeks ago when Real suffered a humiliating 4-0 home thrashing at the hands of a rejuvenated Barcelona, who are already looking capable of making a serious push for all silverware next season. A major criticism of Ancelotti throughout the season is that he has shown a very limited ability to rotate his squad, repeatedly lining up with pretty much the same starting XI irrespective of how well they are playing. With Benzema unavailable for last month's Clasico, Real's lack of strategic variety was exposed to an alarming degree as Barca cantered to an unimaginably easy victory - and Ancelotti only weakened his position by a disastrous half-time tactical change which had to be abandoned when the visitors scored two minutes after the restart. For Perez, embarrassing performances of that nature are generally a signal to change the coach: Rafael Benitez was fired shortly after a 4-0 home defeat by Barca in 2015; Julen Lopetegui went immediately after a 5-1 loss at the Nou Camp in 2018, and Santi Solari was dismissed following a 4-1 Champions League home defeat by Ajax a few months later. The suspicion that Perez doesn't entirely trust Ancelotti is strengthened by a simple fact: he has already fired the Italian once, in 2015, when Ancelotti was sacked a year after landing the club's 10th European title.  Back then, a humbling 4-0 mid-season loss against Atletico played a major part in turning Perez against the coach. It looks increasingly likely history will be repeated in the coming weeks, with only another Champions League triumph or a perfect finale to the league campaign expected to be enough to persuade Perez against firing Ancelotti. So if the Italian goes (again), who replaces him this time? As with Manchester United, Mauricio Pochettino has long been linked with a move to the Bernabeu, while Julian Nagelsmann of Bayern Munich is admired by Perez and Real legend Raul is coming increasingly into the picture after an impressive spell in charge of the club's B team. Whoever is at the helm, they will have to oversee a period of transition. Long-standing stalwarts Benzema, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Dani Carvajal must be gradually replaced, while unwanted veterans Gareth Bale, Isco and Marcelo will leave at the end of the season when their contracts expire. The midfield can be rejuvenated by more prominent roles for Fede Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga, who have been largely sidelined by Ancelotti's ongoing insistence on starting with Modric, Kroos and Casemiro whenever possible. Looming largest in the background, however, is Kylian Mbappe. Real have done everything possible over the past few years to lure French superstar Mbappe away from Paris St-Germain, and it appears inevitable that the long-standing quest to bring him to the Bernabeu will finally bear fruit this summer.  His coaching preferences are bound to be taken into consideration before his eventual arrival. With Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland also targeted by Perez, who is desperate to retain his club's place among Europe's elite despite the financial advantages of clubs such as PSG and Manchester City, the starting XI for Real Madrid next season could look very different to the batch of players routinely selected by Ancelotti.  And so could the figure in the dugout.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60919616"},
{"title": "Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp's Reds take control of Champions League semi", "content": "2680 Liverpool took a giant stride towards another Champions League final with a commanding victory over Villarreal at Anfield.  Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing Reds had to demonstrate patience to break down a Villarreal side well organised by European specialist Unai Emery.  Liverpool were held at bay despite creating all the chances and needed a touch of fortune to break the deadlock after 53 minutes when Jordan Henderson's cross was deflected beyond Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli by Pervis Estupinan.  Sadio Mane increased Liverpool's control when he touched Mohamed Salah's pass beyond Rulli two minutes later. The second leg in Villarreal is still to come next Tuesday but Liverpool now look firmly on course to meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Paris in May. Liverpool just seem to be gathering unstoppable momentum as all challenges, even from a Villarreal side that claimed the scalps of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds, are overcome.  Villarreal set out to take the sting out of the home team from the first whistle, taking an age over goal-kicks and other restarts, but unlike the frustration that overtook them at times against Everton at Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool remained composed, seemingly safe in their knowledge that their chance would come.  And so it proved as they moved through the gears at the start of the second half, a change of tempo that proved too much for Villarreal, with Fabinho having a goal disallowed even before Henderson's attempted cross took that crucial touch off Estupinan.  Klopp was able to remove the tireless Henderson and goalscorer Mane from the fray as Liverpool remained in control.  Liverpool possess such threat that it is almost impossible for a team to simply sit out and hope to keep them away, such is the array of attacking riches now at Klopp's disposal.  It is a collection of such power that he was able to keep Diogo Jota on the bench until that two-goal cushion was established, such has been the stunning impact of January signing Luis Diaz.  Diaz gave an electrifying performance, with two first-half shots that were simply too powerful for Rulli to hold, while his change of pace troubled Villarreal all night.  Klopp and Liverpool will take nothing for granted but such is their form and confidence, it is hard to see how even a side as durable as Villarreal can haul this back.  Liverpool now turn their attentions back to the Premier League pursuit of Manchester City when they travel to in-form Newcastle United on Saturday (12:30 BST). The historic quadruple is still on and the celebrations at the final whistle here suggested the Kop believes that what most observers thought was impossible is now a genuine possibility.  Emery's body language and impassioned gestures in the closing moments, enraged when Villarreal players conceded possession, suggested he thinks his side are still in this Champions League semi-final despite a two-goal deficit.  He has every right to hold out hope with his stellar record in these two-leg formats, having won the Europa League four times with Sevilla and Villarreal and defied the odds to take 'the Yellow Submarine' into the last four of the Champions League.  It will surely require something spectacular, even for this European expert, for Villarreal to disrupt a side of Liverpool's stature.  Villarreal were drilled to the last detail in defence but they were not given any opportunity to launch the devastating counter-attacks that did such damage to Juventus and Bayern Munich.  Emery can never be discounted but Villarreal did not show enough here to suggest they can stop Liverpool reaching their third Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp.  Sadio Mané Formation    4-3-3 Formation    4-4-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61233604"},
{"title": "Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Benzema hat-trick puts Spaniards in charge in Champions League last eight", "content": "1542 Chelsea's hold on the Champions League hangs precariously after Karim Benzema's hat-trick put Real Madrid in a position of power following the quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge.  Real coach Carlo Ancelotti made a winning return to the club where he won the Premier League and FA Cup double after veteran France striker Benzema delivered his latest masterclass.  Benzema, 34 and fresh from the treble that sunk Paris St-Germain in the last 16, punished holders Chelsea with two magnificent headers in the space of three minutes midway through the first half.  Kai Havertz's header gave Chelsea hope before the break but keeper Edouard Mendy's poor clearance seconds after the restart gifted Benzema his third to put Real in command of the tie before the second leg at the Bernabeu next Tuesday (12 April). Chelsea battled to the end of this first leg but were always fighting an uphill task after they were hit by Benzema's brilliant one-two and then saw their hopes of mounting a comeback wrecked by a self-inflicted wound.  Real had already delivered a warning about the danger they posed when Vinicius Junior hit the bar but that went unheeded as he provided the cross for Benzema's flying headed opener.  And once Benzema had confirmed his aerial threat with a second, Chelsea were always vulnerable against a side who are the masters of these Champions League situations.  Havertz, the match-winner in last season's Champions League final win against Manchester City, gave a subdued Stamford Bridge some hope but the entire destiny of the tie may have turned in the opening 40 seconds after the interval.  Mendy, normally so reliable, made an expensive misjudgement when he raced from goal only to send a weak pass in the direction of Antonio Rudiger.  The defender was unable to gain control and the predatory Benzema was in like a flash to roll the ball into the unguarded net with Mendy looking on in anguish.  It came just after Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel had introduced Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech at the start of the second half to build on Havertz's goal, but the changes were undermined before they had any chance to take effect.  Tuchel later brought on Romelu Lukaku in a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation but his struggles were summed up when he sent a weak header wide with one of Chelsea's best chances of the night.  Chelsea have demonstrated an ability to overcome adversity in the past but with Real holding a two-goal advantage going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, it would rank as one of their finest achievements if they were to reach the last four from this position.  Real Madrid may be runaway leaders in La Liga but Carlo Ancelotti's side were regarded as rank outsiders as they chase a 14th triumph in this competition in its guises as the European Cup and Champions League.  Yet, after the dramatic comeback against the odds to knock out Paris St-Germain in the last 16, with this show of experience and class at Stamford Bridge they demonstrated once again that their credentials are dismissed at your peril. And in Ancelotti, for all the speculation surrounding his long-term future at the Bernabeu, they have a leader who has demonstrated his expertise by winning this trophy three times with AC Milan and Real.  The coach and Real's players showed they are old hands at this and how they punished Chelsea, with Benzema and the 36-year-old Croatia maestro Luka Modric at their heart, to take a giant stride towards the semi-final.  Benzema gets better with age, scoring two headers of the highest class before poaching a third goal, while Modric retains that priceless ability to control the tempo of games, retain possession and always make the right choice from the options available.  Ancelotti will take nothing for granted but the veteran Italian, who flew into London on the day of the game after recovering from Covid-19, cut a highly satisfied figure at the final whistle.

The home side were superb from the outset and led inside 10 minutes when Danjuma stabbed in from close range. Francis Coquelin had a goal ruled out while Gerard Moreno hit the post as Villarreal pushed for a second. German champions Bayern were well below par and did not manage a shot on target until the second half. Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 51 goals for club and country this season, was kept quiet by a well-organised Villarreal defence as the hosts followed up their impressive win against Juventus in the previous round with another big result. But as poor as Bayern were they will feel they can turn things round against the Spanish side in the return leg on Tuesday, 12 April. They will need to play significantly better than they did in this game as they suffered their first Champions League defeat away from home since 2017. Indeed, Bayern's players will likely come away relieved that they only have a one-goal deficit as Villarreal had a plethora of chances to win by a bigger margin. Coquelin was narrowly offside before seeing his cross fly over Manuel Neuer's head and as well as Moreno's shot against the post they really should have got a second in the final few minutes when substitute Alfonso Pedraza shot wide from close range. Kingsley Coman saw an effort saved by Geronimo Rulli at his near post in stoppage time but an equaliser would have been supremely harsh on brilliant Villarreal, who understandably celebrated wildly when the full-time whistle was blown.

{"title": "Tottenham move closer to Champions League qualification as Arsenal and Man Utd wobble", "content": "It is just over a week since Antonio Conte said it would be a \"miracle\" if his Tottenham team finished in the Premier League's top four and qualified for the Champions League. On 1 April Spurs were three points behind the Gunners, having played one game more and with an inferior goal difference.  But fast forward a week and Tottenham have thrashed Newcastle 5-1 and on  Saturday won 4-0 at Aston Villa,  while the Gunners have suffered back-to-back defeats - the surprising 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace on Monday and  Saturday's 2-1 home reverse to a Brighton side  who had not won in their previous seven matches. Since Conte's remarks, another of their top-four rivals, Manchester United, have picked up one point from a possible six, drawing 1-1 with Leicester last week before  losing 1-0 at Everton on Saturday. Of their rivals for the final Champions League place, only West Ham have won since the Italian's comments, beating Everton 2-1 last weekend. They travel to Brentford on Sunday. The past week means Tottenham, five points adrift of the top four when Conte took charge in November, must now be favourites to secure Champions League qualification.  They are fourth and three points clear of their north London rivals with a significantly better goal difference, though the Gunners do have a game in hand. Tottenham lost 2-0 in the Champions League final to Liverpool in 2019, but in 2020-21 were only in the Europa League and this season played in the newly formed third-tier competition the Europa Conference League. Under Conte, they suffered an embarrassing 2-1 loss to Slovenian side NS Mura in November as they failed to make it out of the group, although Covid-19 cases meant Spurs could not play their final match, with Rennes awarded an automatic 3-0 victory. In February,  following a 1-0 loss at Burnley  - Tottenham's fourth defeat in five Premier League games - Conte suggested he could walk away from the club, saying: \"I came here to help the club and if the problem could be the coach I'm ready to go, no problem\". But Spurs have won six of seven league games since then, including all of the past four. After the 4-0 victory against Aston Villa, in which Son Heung-min scored a hat-trick with Dejan Kulusevski, on loan from Juventus, also on the scoresheet, Conte said: \"I'm very happy because I have a group of players who want to show me they will improve in many aspects. \"Seven games to go and we're showing we are deserving to stay in the race for a place in the Champions League. \"We need to continue to work with this application and intensity and desire because the club deserves much better than fighting for fifth, sixth or seventh. I like to be competitive.\" Tottenham played in the late game on Saturday and had been boosted by Manchester United and Arsenal's losses respectively against Everton and Brighton earlier in the day. Three-time European champions United are seventh, below West Ham on goal difference, a position that would only be good enough to qualify them for the Europa Conference League at best if they end the season in that spot. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick, in the job until the end of the season, challenged United's players to prove they deserve to be in the top competition. \"The players themselves should be eager to play international football, if possible Champions League,\" said Rangnick. \"But if we play like we did here we just don't deserve it. In order to qualify for Europe you have to be able to score in 95 minutes in a game like this.\" Arsenal have not played in the Champions League since 2016-17 and manager Mikel Arteta admitted it had been a \"tough week\" for the Gunners. He added: \"We wanted a reaction [to the defeat at Crystal Palace]. It came in the second half, which is too late; we have to have the courage and personality to play much better and raise the level. \"We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward. We've shown for many weeks how well we can play; it has been a difficult week and we've lost some big players. \"There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61055379"},
{"title": "Chelsea face biggest escapology task yet to overturn Champions League deficit against Real Madrid", "content": "Chelsea have made a habit of snatching successes amid adversity and instability - but their current plight surely means retaining the Champions League crown will be beyond even their powers of escapology. Stricken by sanctions imposed on owner Roman Abramovich for alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin and with three of four shortlisted potential successors watching at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea suffered another blow in what is developing into a chaotic season.  Chelsea have navigated a route out of hazardous situations in this competition in the past but even their ability to defy the odds will surely not run to overturning  a 3-1 quarter-final deficit  in the second leg against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Thomas Tuchel's side came into the tie off the back of  Brentford's stunning 4-1 win  at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and the after-shocks remained in a shaky defensive display.  And with a world-class striker in Karim Benzema seemingly on a personal mission to bring the trophy to Real Madrid for the 14th time, this was another bad 90 minutes for Chelsea and Tuchel.  It was not a great advert for those wishing to purchase Chelsea with their billions but past history tells us never to write them off.   Real could have been out of sight by half-time as they swamped forward and exposed Chelsea's vulnerabilities with painful regularity. It was no surprise Tuchel was so critical of his side's performance in that first 45 minutes.  He said: \"We have to find our level back, I don't know where it is since the international break, but the first half is a repetition of the second half against Brentford, in a quarter-final against Real Madrid. \"We were so far off our level in everything the game demands. It's on all of us, I'm included in this. Individually we lost shape and sharpness in the international break. \"I don't have really an explanation because we have fallen from being very, very competitive.\" Chelsea had their chances, with former keeper Thibaut Courtois saving brilliantly from Cesar Azpilicueta in the second half, but Real carried that air of authority afforded by years of travelling around this particular block, a stature personified by Benzema. And how the 34-year-old France striker's ability to improve with age provided a sharp contrast to the struggles of Romelu Lukaku, who looks more like a £97m misfit with every passing week.  Benzema gave the complete performance with two masterly first-half headers and a poacher's instinct to punish Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy's error early in the second half. He actually missed an easy chance to complete his hat-trick earlier but this was a minor flaw in a masterclass.  Lukaku, in contrast, appears to be Chelsea's weapon of last resort, not truly trusted by his manager and with confidence fragile.  He was only introduced when Chelsea were 3-1 down to Brentford on Saturday and it was the same drill here.  And, emphasising the gulf in class compared to Benzema, Chelsea's fans groaned in unison as he guided a weak header wide of the target with time and space when given a chance to at least inflict a modicum of pressure on Real.  Lukaku still has time to make an impact on Chelsea's season with an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace to come, a Premier League top-four place to fight for and the second leg against Real - but he is running out of time.  The theory, when he returned to Chelsea from Inter Milan in the summer, was that Lukaku would be the missing piece in a side that had won the Champions League but was still prone to over-generosity in front of goal.  Amid interviews revealing public discontent at his role, average performances and regular exclusion from Chelsea's starting line-ups, it simply has not worked.  A Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid is surely exactly the sort of game Lukaku was brought to Stamford Bridge to influence. He did not start here. He did not even start against Brentford. It is a damning reflection on his form.  It would be harsh to blame Lukaku for this loss but the enduring brilliance of Benzema did shine a light on the Belgian's struggles.  Asked if the tie was still alive Tuchel replied \"no\" but Chelsea will still travel to Madrid with some hope. However, they are up against canny operators in Real and their coach Carlo Ancelotti, a three-time winner of this tournament.  He even felt able to give former Arsenal loan player Dani Ceballos and the rarely-spotted - for Real Madrid anyway - Gareth Bale a trot in the closing moments as they ran down the clock.  This was Chelsea's first loss to Real in six meetings and memories are still fresh of how they overcame Zinedine Zidane's side, who had previously dispatched Liverpool, in last season's semi-final.  Times and circumstances have changed and this time Chelsea will be at the Bernabeu rather than behind closed doors at what was effectively Real's training ground.  Chelsea have turned many hazardous situations around in the Champions League. If they can pull off a comeback in the second leg to reach the last four then Tuchel can rank it along their finest achievements. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61018886"},
{"title": "Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Karim Benzema 'getting better with age' after another star showing", "content": "Karim Benzema has not just stepped out of Cristiano Ronaldo's shadow at Real Madrid but grabbed the spotlight and focused it squarely on himself. The striker may be 34 but he is only getting better as he gets older and on Wednesday night he singlehandedly put Chelsea, the Champions League holders, on the brink of a quarter-final exit. Benzema scored a hat-trick, his second in as many games in Europe, as Real Madrid won 3-1 at Stamford Bridge in the first-leg encounter. The France international's excellent form this season comes against the backdrop of a  conviction  for blackmail,  which he is appealing against. His latest goals took him to 11 in the Champions League this season - only Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski has scored more with 12. \"This is the business end and he is still scoring goals,\" former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport. \"He has shot his team to the top of the league. They are flying and he is the talisman. \"When Cristiano Ronaldo was there Benzema had the humility to sit in the background because he knew what it meant to the team but now he has come out of the shadows.\" The claim to be considered the best out-and-out striker in the world right now is quite a competitive one. Lewandowski has phenomenal record for club and country with 51 goals this season, although he was unable to prevent Bayern from slipping to a 1-0 loss at Villarreal in their quarter-final first leg. Then there is Kylian Mbappe at Paris St-Germain, Erling Braut Haaland at Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham's Harry Kane. \"Benzema is 34 and he is the best number nine in the world,\" added Ferdinand. \"He is another level. Goals, assists, link up play.\" Former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Karen Carney echoed Ferdinand's sentiment that Benzema is one of the best in the world right now. \"He showed everyone watching what a world-class striker he is,\" she told BBC Radio 5 live. \"His movement, his finishing, what he brings to this Real Madrid team, it was just breath-taking to watch him at times.\" Former Liverpool and Real Madrid winger Steve McManaman said: \"He knows he doesn't have to fly into the box. He arrives really late and his experience counts for everything. \"Every time he steps on the pitch he looks like he will score. His movement is really clever.\" The stats speak for themselves. Benzema has now scored four hat-tricks for Real Madrid in European competitions - only Alfredo di Stefano (five), Ferenc Puskas (five) and Ronaldo (seven) have managed more. His 11 goals in the Champions League this season have come in just eight games, while he has 37 in 36 matches in all competitions for Real. Benzema finished fourth in the running for last year's Ballon d'Or, behind Jorginho, Lewandowski and winner Lionel Messi, but his current form will surely put him among the early frontrunners for the award, which is handed out in October. \"He is getting better with age,\" former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole said on BT Sport. He added: \"As things stand right now in the race for the Ballon d'Or he has won it by a few furlongs. \"It is unbelievable that in this stage of his career he has gone: 'I am in charge of the orchestra now, everything goes through me'.  \"He is an outstanding footballer.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61018776"},

{"title": "Villarreal: The small-town team threatening to knock out Bayern Munich from Champions League", "content": "The line-up for this season's Champions League quarter-finals contains teams from Madrid (two), Munich, Lisbon, London, Manchester and Liverpool - some of Europe's largest and most influential cities. There is also Villarreal, a team from an industrial city of the same name in eastern Spain with a population of 50,000 and, some might say, little right to be keeping such exalted company. And yet a shock  1-0 win over German champions Bayern Munich  last week means the Yellow Submarine, as Villarreal are nicknamed, go into Tuesday's second leg with the chance to reach a first semi-final in Europe's premier club competition since 2006. But their success should not come as a surprise. Despite their size, they have qualified for Europe in 17 of the past 22 seasons. When Marcos Senna joined the club after arriving from Brazil in 2002, things were very different. Villarreal were in only their fourth La Liga campaign and featured mostly in the now defunct Intertoto Cup. They have since become one of the strongest sides in Spain, going on to  beat Manchester United in the Europa League final  last season to lift their first trophy - a landmark moment. The club is at the heart of the city, and the 21,626 crowd that watched the win over Bayern is a figure not far off half its population. Many of those will have entered the club's Ceramica stadium that night through gate number 19. Or, as it has been known for a decade, the Marcos Senna gate, a tribute to one of the club's most celebrated footballers. A Euro 2008 winner, the Spanish-Brazilian has seen it all and argues that, unlike what others may think, playing for a small-city team can be a dream come true. \"Obviously, this is not a place for partygoers,\" Senna, who currently works as the club's director of institutional relations, told BBC Sport. \"No team wants players who are always out in nightclubs and Villarreal were so serious about that in the past that they didn't even accept anyone living in Valencia [which is around a 45-minute drive away], so they could have some control. It's not like this any more though - I'd say half of the squad now lives there, and I also do. \"If you come with the right mentality, this can be a very easy area to adapt to. We are close to the mountains and beaches, have incredible weather the entire year, the club are always playing in the first division, pay on time and provide everything you need. \"So you get here and you don't want to leave. When I arrived, I didn't plan to stay long. And now look at me, 20 years on and still loving it here.\" Unfortunately for Bayern, nothing much has changed after the Europa League title. \"It's all the same, except for one thing: we no longer have that pressure of never reaching finals. We got there for the first time and we won it,\" Senna said. \"We had been working hard and doing things well for so many seasons that football kind of owed us one. But we want more. We know if we knock Bayern out, things will get serious.\" Despite being a family-run team and having a considerably smaller budget compared to their Champions League rivals, Villarreal have managed to consistently challenge big guns from other countries over the years. No-one had expected them to upset the odds against Juventus in the last 16, but after a 1-1 home draw in the first leg they won 3-0 in Turin. It was arguably the best night in their European history. They achieved it via a shrewd recruitment strategy, often signing players who have faltered elsewhere and giving them a second chance. Their manager, Unai Emery, himself fits that mould, having been sacked by Paris-St Germain and Arsenal.  His team has a backline that combines the youthful energy of highly rated local boy Pau Torres with the experience of former Real Madrid and Napoli centre-back Raul Albiol, a European champion in 2008. In midfield, they have Tottenham Hotspur loanee Giovani lo Celso in great form and in attack they have ex-Bournemouth forward Arnaut Danjuma and last season's Europa League top scorer Gerard Moreno. Unsurprisingly, the Yellow Submarine have been hailed as one of the best success stories in football. \"None of this happened overnight. It's the result of 25 years of work,\" Senna explained. \"It's no exaggeration to say Villarreal were lucky to find Fernando [Roig], a great businessman who wanted to bring new ideas and create our own philosophy. We could go beyond and do some mad business in the transfer market, but that's not us. \"Other fans say 'Villarreal's owner has lots of money'. Yes, that's true, but behind all this there is a great project. You see other teams that have investors and things just don't click. It's not like this here. \"Fernando's son [Fernando Roig Negueroles, the club's chief executive] has been in charge of our transfer policy and is the most responsible for what Villarreal have become today. \"When players arrive here, they know they will be playing for a side that is always fighting for a top-six finish in La Liga, that are regularly in Europe and have an average attendance of 17,000. No fan will ever bother you and you always have that full stadium feeling. It's quality of life in all aspects.\" Senna was a key cog in the Villarreal team defeated by Arsenal in the 2005-06 Champions League semi-final. If they can beat Bayern on Tuesday and reach the same stage again, the former midfielder would rate their chances higher this time. \"Back then, we had a much smaller budget and also an inferior team than the one we have now,\" Senna added. \"When I say inferior, it's because we weren't covered in all areas.

{"title": "Real Madrid v Chelsea: How Karim Benzema has become one of world's top strikers", "content": "\"When you play with a guy who scored 50 or 60 goals a season, of course, you are at the service of the player because he is someone who scored a lot,\" Karim Benzema said.  \"I had to adapt; I adapted. He left. So it was down to me to make a step forward and show that I could make the difference.\"  These were Benzema's words when asked about his roles at Real Madrid with and without Cristiano Ronaldo. The France forward will lead Real's attack in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea on Tuesday, having scored a hat-trick in last week's first leg at Stamford Bridge. It was his second hat-trick in successive European club games, having hit three as Paris St-Germain were eliminated in the last 16. Benzema has been in prolific form despite off-field problems - he is appealing against a  conviction for blackmail,  having been found guilty by a French court last November. On the pitch, the striker has scored 11 Champions League this season - a total bettered only by Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski, who has 12. Benzema, 34, spent years in Ronaldo's shadow at the Bernabeu. Yet while he was once primarily a creator for others, the Frenchman has now emerged as Real's main man - and one of the most clinical attackers in Europe. Indeed, since Ronaldo's exit in 2018, Benzema has hit 77 goals in 131 matches for the Blancos. So how has he done it? Benzema is scoring frequently, but it shouldn't be overlooked that he is also scoring high-quality goals. The striker is producing finishes that aren't possible for many forwards on a technical level, both with his feet and his head. It hasn't always been this way. The Frenchman used to be criticised heavily for his finishing. He was really struggling as Ronaldo began his final season with Real. In a 2-2 draw against Valencia in August 2017, Benzema missed six big chances - and was booed by large sections of the Bernabeu. Those struggles continued throughout that season. During 2017-18, Benzema underperformed his La Liga expected goals (xG) tally by 8.97 goals - in other words, he scored nine goals fewer than would be expected from the chances he had. Contrast that to this season, where his 24 La Liga goals have come from an xG of 19.85. Benzema's delicate touch and control has always been a standout feature of his game but now he is using it to greater effect inside the penalty area. The statistics bear that out. In 2017-18, Benzema managed 93 touches in the opposing penalty area. This season, he is set to pass that comfortably, having reached 86 with more than a month of the campaign still to go. And he is producing the skill to go with it - scoring from chances that would elude many forwards. It used to be common to see Benzema playing with his back to goal and looking to bring Ronaldo and others into play. He still does that sometimes, but the Frenchman now more often collects the ball facing the goal. In the four years since Ronaldo left, Benzema has changed tack - lining up as Real Madrid's central striker but often pulling into the inside-left channel. From there, his decision-making takes over.  For all of his technical traits, one of Benzema's greatest strengths is his football intelligence. When he rolls inside from the left, he knows exactly what he needs to do next. He proved it when France came from a goal down to beat Spain in the Nations League final last October. After gaining a half-yard of space inside Spain's right-back Cesar Azpilicueta, Benzema quickly computed that there were no other team-mates in a better position to score, so he whipped the ball over goalkeeper Unai Simon from an audacious angle to score a vital equaliser. Then with 10 minutes left, and the game poised at 1-1, Benzema got himself into a similar inside-left position. This time, he detected Kylian Mbappe's run on the right side of the box and created a chance for him to win the match and the trophy.  Benzema is so effective from this area of the field. In La Liga this season, 48% of Benzema's touches outside of the box have come down the left third of the pitch. His positioning has also contributed to a potent partnership with Brazilian left winger Vinicius Junior, who has 17 goals in all competitions for Real this season. Benzema and Vinicius have combined for 18 goals this season - that is, where one has assisted the other to score. A common ploy has been Benzema dropping deep to pull an opposition centre-back out of the defensive line, which creates space for Vinicius to use his electric pace to run in behind off the left wing.  \"There are forwards who do not touch a ball during the match, then comes the 87th minute in which they score and they are super happy. Personally if I don't contribute much with the ball, but I score in the 90th minute, I'm disgusted.\"  This is a Benzema quote from 2017 - and despite his vast improvement as a goalscorer in the five years since, the essence of those words still shine through in his play today.  He is still often the central link man for many of Real Madrid's attacks - as he showed against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last week. His superb finish was only one part of his contribution to the first goal as he twice linked the play in the build-up too.  In fact, Benzema is not only La Liga's top goalscorer this season but he is also the top of the assists chart with 11, showing the complete number nine he has become. Benzema is maintaining his classical traits as a playmaker and extracting the best from his team-mates, but now combining this with phenomenal goalscoring numbers. It may yet carry him into contention for the Ballon d'Or. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61069998"},
{"title": "Fans' group criticises Uefa's plan for 36-team Champions League", "content": "A Premier League supporters' group has accused Uefa of attempting to return to the \"discredited idea of a European Super League\" with its plans to revamp the Champions League. A 12-team European Super League was announced last year. However, all but three clubs - Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona - pulled out after widespread protests. Around the same time,  Uefa unveiled plans  for a revamped 36-team Champions League, starting in 2024.  The expanded competition will increase the number group stage matches from six to 10 and reserve two qualification spots to allow clubs to participate based on historic European performance instead of domestic achievement.  Uefa's executive committee will make a final decision on the plans on 10 May, but the Football Supporters' Association's Premier League Network said the proposed 36-team tournament would \"entrench the richest clubs, damage the English football pyramid and rip off fans\".  \"We are united in opposition to proposals to reform the Champions League that are a back door attempt at a return to the discredited idea of a European Super League,\" read the FSA Premier League Network statement.  \"Last year, it was our supporter groups that united to force the collapse of the European Super League. At the time, Uefa told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans' views would be centre stage in deciding what came next. \"So it is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year 'Uefa club co-efficient'. \"These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrifice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games.\" The new format will see 36 clubs qualifying for an expanded first phase, where all clubs play against 10 opponents of varying strengths. This will result in a league table, with the top eight qualifying for the knockout phase and the next 16 going into a play-off to determine the remaining eight slots. Under its latest proposal, teams could only qualify via the co-efficient if they finished immediately outside the regular Champions League spots, to avoid them leapfrogging rivals who finished in a higher position.  However, the FSA Premier League Network's statement said such plans were \"irresponsible and out of touch\", stating it could double the number of home matches in the group stages in a competition that favours the continent's richest cubs.  \"Premier League fans do not want 10 group games involving a small cartel of rich clubs further distorting competitive balance,\" the statement added. \"We want strong, competitive domestic leagues, an equal opportunity for all to qualify for Uefa competitions based on sporting merit, along with a fairer distribution of the game's wealth from the revenues those competitions earn. \"Last year, we engaged in constructive discussions with Uefa president (Aleksander) Ceferin who made a commitment that fans would be listened to in this process. Our collective voice is unified and our position clear. \"We call on Uefa to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61018742"},
{"title": "Real Madrid 3-1 Paris St-Germain (3-2 agg): Does PSG's Champions League exit spell the end for Mauricio Pochettino?", "content": "Mauricio Pochettino says the \"next few weeks are not going to be easy\" after his Paris St-Germain side  let a 2-0 aggregate lead slip  in their Champions League exit to Real Madrid.  With an hour gone in the second leg, the visitors were in complete control thanks to Kylian Mbappe's second goal of the tie. But they were left stunned by Karim Benzema's 17-minute hat-trick and suffered another painful exit from the competition they covet more than any other.  \"The first [Benzema] goal completely changed the game,\" said Pochettino.  \"For an hour, we were better than Real Madrid. The atmosphere changed in the stadium. We made some mistakes after that, we can't say we didn't. The worst feeling is that we were the better side, but we lost the tie in 10 minutes.  \"Paris St-Germain have been chasing the Champions League for a number of years now.  \"I'm really disappointed, upset - but these things can happen. The next few weeks are not going to be easy.\" Since moving under Qatari ownership in 2011, PSG have assembled a series of star-studded squads. But their dreams of winning European club football's elite competition have been repeatedly undermined by several collapses from winning positions, including  the 6-1 thrashing by Barcelona  in 2017 and the  last-16 defeat by Manchester United  in 2019. \"We have been here before with PSG. Too many times, this is a huge failure. A lot is down to the players on the pitch because you can't make these mistakes,\" French football journalist Julien Laurens told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"Pochettino will not be there next season, I can tell you that - unless they can't get [Zinedine] Zidane in. I don't even think he wants to be there; he wants to be in England.  \"His family is still in London and he has been in a hotel in Paris for a year and maybe that is part of the problem. You can't let your team sink like they did tonight without responding. He has been too reactive.\" Laurens also criticised Pochettino's regular rotating of his two goalkeepers, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Keylor Navas, and questioned whether the players had the right focus to improve their away form - they have won just one of four Ligue 1 matches on their travels since the turn of the year. \"The goalkeeping situation is crazy,\" Laurens said. \"He doesn't put them in the right environment to be good. You never know who will play next. \"The away form is not good enough - not just in the Champions League. They have a huge problem psychologically away from home because they don't put the effort in. They can't grind out a result when under pressure. \"The complacency is what gets me - when you have thrown away leads like this and yet you are still complacent like they were tonight. This is the Champions League and it came back to haunt them.\" Former England midfielder Steve McManaman, who won the Champions League twice during his time at Real Madrid, gave a damning assessment of another PSG failure in the competition. The Ligue 1 leaders reached the final and semi-finals in consecutive seasons but have also been knocked out at the last-16 stage in four of their past six Champions League campaigns. \"We expected PSG to unravel. They did what they always do, when they come under pressure, they melt away,\" said McManaman on BT Sport. \"There was no organisation and no leadership. The players are too powerful. When the going gets tough, they do not care. They just play whatever they want to play. \"You can't have four or five [players] not fancy it when the going gets tough. \"PSG made mistakes constantly in the second half. You have to give Real credit because even when they are down, they stay in the game. \"We have seen managers come and go and they cannot sort it out. They come, they get knocked out of the Champions League and get sacked and then move on.\" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand echoed those sentiments, adding: \"It is the mentality and maybe the culture of the club.  \"This isn't something that is new at the club. They have fantastic talent in the squad but when the mentality isn't right on the day, you have to stay in the game. They didn't do that. It is part of the ingrained culture at PSG.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60683636"},
{"title": "Manchester United lose to Atletico Madrid: 'Watershed moment for Old Trafford bosses'", "content": "2657 Manchester United's limitations were laid bare as Atletico Madrid did a classic Champions League number on them to snuff out their slender hopes of success for another season.  United's limitations mean a last-16 exit is about par for the course given their current reduced status. And those limitations mean their only hope of anything resembling salvation from this mess of a campaign rest on finishing in the Premier League's top four.  It will also be the measure of whether the experiment of handing Ralf Rangnick the levers of control can be judged a success - albeit a very qualified one - because if United do not overhaul Arsenal or any other contenders, then it must be deemed a failure.  Manchester United are currently a point behind Arsenal, who lie fourth, but have played three games more and do not present a convincing case that they can climb that particular hill. In an ironic twist, just as  United's players trudged off after a 1-0 defeat  that carried every hallmark and characteristic of Diego Simeone's streetwise Atletico, television screens at Old Trafford were showing images of Ajax coach Erik ten Hag.  Here was the visionary touted by many as the ideal candidate to drag United out of their current no-man's land, but who had just presided over Ajax's own last-16 exit after a home loss to Benfica. Ten Hag has a track record but hardly comes with a guarantee. This had the feeling of a watershed moment for those in charge at Manchester United.   Yes, we have all seen this movie before with Atletico Madrid. They defend magnificently. They spoil with well-practised dark arts, then dig you on the counter-attack before dropping deep and erecting the sort of defensive barricade on which so many have floundered over the years.  United were full of effort but showed little guile. Once the early storm had blown itself out and Renan Lodi headed what would prove to be the decisive goal, the beneficiary of non-existent marking, Atletico had United pretty much where they wanted them.  It does help to have defenders who seem to live for being under pressure and penned in their own penalty area, plus a world-class keeper in Jan Oblak happy to use every part of his anatomy to defy opponents, whether it is his face to stop Anthony Elanga or a giant claw to save brilliantly from Raphael Varane late on.  United's main hope, as it has been for some time, is to cross fingers and hope for a moment of individual brilliance. Cristiano Ronaldo provided it with a hat-trick to beat Tottenham on Saturday. There was no such impact here and out went United, running short of ideas and invention long before the inevitable conclusion.  United's place in the domestic and European order is clear for everyone to see. They are also-rans at home and abroad.  Ronaldo started in a blaze of tricks but fizzled out. Bruno Fernandes threatened to influence but, as usual, descended into spending too much time bickering with officials - all while Atletico set the familiar traps plucked straight from the Simeone playbook.  And in Harry Maguire, Manchester United have a captain playing with an air of desperation. His dawdling, panicky play in possession resulted in frequent groans around Old Trafford. His removal to applause - as he was replaced by veteran Juan Mata late on - was a signal both of his struggles and of Rangnick's own desperate straits. Manchester United's fans, plenty of them anyway, do not trust Maguire on the ball and it often seems as if he does not trust himself either, his confidence clearly fragile.  It is to be hoped United's decision makers will use this loss to crystallise thoughts on several matters - but mainly who will be manager next season.  This process has to have started already and no-one could seriously suggest Rangnick will be anything more elevated than the consultancy role proposed for him next season.  In his defence, United's failure can hardly all be placed at his door. The rot had set in long before his arrival to succeed the sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Norwegian's appointment itself a sign of sentimentality and limited ambition, phrases that would never see the light of day at Manchester City and Liverpool as they streak so far ahead of United.  Will Thomas Tuchel feature in United's thoughts amid the turmoil at Chelsea? If not, he should. Mauricio Pochettino's reputation took a hit with Paris St-Germain's capitulation at Real Madrid while Ten Hag's Ajax were shocked by Benfica.  Too many players seem discontented or not good enough. Whoever the new manager, he faces a mammoth task.  Edinson Cavani graced Old Trafford with presence in the second half but is playing out time. Will Ronaldo fancy the Europa League for the finale to his magnificent career?  As United flailed, Atletico celebrated. Simeone has done it again. As he did to Liverpool at this stage of the Champions League two years ago.  He sprinted straight down to the Stretford End and off at the final whistle, some Manchester United fans doing themselves no credit whatsoever by hurling drinks and objects at the Argentine. Simeone seemed spectacularly unconcerned and later emerged smiling in the directors' box posing for pictures with fans, saving a grin of particularly high wattage for a supporter who directed some old-fashioned verbal disapproval in his direction.  Simeone and Atletico go on into the last eight again while Manchester United contemplate a future riddled with uncertainty.  That future starts now.

Ralf Rangnick's side were not short on endeavour but lacked the guile to break down Atletico's trademark resilience as Renan Lodi's far-post header four minutes before half-time sent the Spanish champions into the last eight.  United dominated possession for large portions of the second half but, as they have done so often, Atletico built a wall of defensive resistance - and when they did threaten, goalkeeper Jan Oblak provided the final barrier.  He saved brilliantly from Raphael Varane's header in front of the Stretford End as United were left to fight for a place in next season's Champions League in the final weeks of the domestic season.  Manchester United went the same way as so many teams before them who have suffered at the hands of this remarkably durable Atletico machine assembled by Diego Simeone.  United showed plenty of effort and had Old Trafford rocking with a high-intensity start but they simply ran out of ideas and inspiration the longer the game went on - Atletico digging in and defending with the sort of relish they have shown many times over the years. Cristiano Ronaldo produced a couple of classic early touches but he was a peripheral figure long before the end, with Rangnick and United's desperation illustrated when struggling captain Harry Maguire was replaced by veteran Juan Mata.  United were also infuriated by the erratic refereeing of Slovenian official Slavko Vincic, particularly when they felt Anthony Elanga had been fouled moments before Lodi arrived unmarked to head home Antoine Griezmann's cross at the far post.  Over the two legs, however, United have simply not been good enough to progress and now face an uphill task to reach the Premier League's top four, as they lie fifth behind Arsenal having played three games more.  At the final whistle, Atletico coach Simeone showed a neat turn of pace to turn left and sprint off towards an infuriated Stretford End, straight down the tunnel without a backwards glance, pelted with objects and drinks as he disappeared from view.  Behind him, Manchester United players and fans were left with a familiar feeling of having the rug pulled out from under them by Simeone - and by the Atletico side he has drilled so fiercely and with such discipline.  Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp felt exactly the same after Atletico won at Anfield at this same stage two years ago and while La Liga's champions may not be among the Champions League favourites, no-one will particularly relish being paired with them.

Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate.  \"It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,\" said Emery. \"We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. \"To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. \"In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy.\" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli.  Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many.  Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break.  With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. \"In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,\" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. \"They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through.

It is the fifth successive season City have reached the quarter-finals, while Guardiola has managed a team to this stage for a record-equalling 12th time. \"I'm a guy who learns at the time to enjoy the moment. When I qualify for the quarter-finals, I enjoy it; when I qualify for the last 16, I know how difficult it is,\" said Guardiola, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles as their manager. \"When you go through, every opponent is difficult. Now it is time to congratulate everyone, focus on the Premier League and see the draw.\" City's stunning 5-0 win in last month's first leg in Lisbon had already effectively settled this tie, and it was clear from the outset that the Portuguese side did not entertain any hope of an unlikely comeback. Sporting packed their defence, perhaps wary of suffering another damaging defeat, leaving Guardiola's side in total control of possession but struggling to carve out meaningful chances. Raheem Sterling wasted City's best opportunity before the break when he ran on to Phil Foden's pass and tried to dink the ball over Antonio Adan but did not get enough height on his shot. Gabriel Jesus did find the net for the home side at the start of the second half but a VAR review ruled he was offside from Riyad Mahrez's pass and the goal was disallowed. Despite being unable to make the breakthrough, City remained completely comfortable and Guardiola was relaxed enough to bring on third-choice keeper Scott Carson for Ederson with 20 minutes remaining. The 36-year-old, making his first appearance of the season, was quickly called into action to deny Paulinho from close range, bringing chants of 'England's number one' from the delighted City fans. City will find out their quarter-final opponents on 18 March and Guardiola said it was a \"good sign\" that expectations have risen for the club.  \"The last decade, step by step, the club grew and for many years we were there in the Champions League and qualifying for the last 16,\" he added.  \"Now, again, we're in the quarter-finals and among the best eight teams in Europe.\" This was the first time since the end of October that City had failed to score at home but, while this performance lacked the sparkle of their win in Lisbon, they never loosened their grip on the tie. Sporting did manage some efforts at goal before the end but in the early stages they barely got a kick, and seemed content to try to keep City quiet. Until Sterling ran clear before half-time, there had been precious little goalmouth action at either end but the home fans, still chanting noisily about Sunday's thumping derby win over Manchester United, did not seem to care too much. City's lack of fit or available defenders had been a cause for concern for Guardiola before kick-off but Sporting's lack of ambition meant he had little to worry about on the night, and teenage defender Conrad Egan-Riley acquitted himself well on his debut at this level. So too did veteran midfielder Fernandinho, who was making his 100th Champions League appearance, and seemed to relish his recall to the starting line-up. There are much tougher tests to come for City this season, starting with their trip to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday, but they made effortless progress here.

In a Champions League epic, Mason Mount's wonderful finish and Antonio Rudiger's powerful header wiped out Real's 3-1 first-leg advantage and brought the quarter-final tie level in Spain's capital. Thomas Tuchel's side were outstanding throughout and Timo Werner's clever finish from an angle put them ahead for the first time on aggregate and within sight of a place in the semi-finals. But substitute Rodrygo - after a stunning pass by Luka Modric - forced extra time with a volleyed finish before Karim Benzema, a hat-trick hero in the first leg at Stamford Bridge six days earlier, headed the decisive goal in the 96th minute to send Real through 5-4 on aggregate. Benzema, who had earlier headed against the bar on a rollercoaster night, was unmarked when he scored to break Chelsea's hearts after Rudiger slipped inside the box. Even after what turned out to be the clincher, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho went close to forcing a penalty shootout. In the end Chelsea, who played superbly, were made to pay for their first-leg performance as Tuchel's side fell just short of producing one of the great comebacks in the competition. Many of Chelsea's players slumped to the ground at the end of 120 gripping minutes after pushing record 13-time winners Real - who will face Manchester City or Atletico Madrid in the last four - all the way. Tuchel had said on the eve of this game that Chelsea's progression into the semi-finals would be akin to the best Hollywood script. His players came close to producing a blockbuster in their first game at the Bernabeu in European competition as they showed incredible fight and belief - ingredients which were missing from their  poor performance in the first leg. This breathless game had everything and more, including a Marcos Alonso goal at 2-0 ruled out by the video assistant referee for handball. While Tuchel will be delighted with the way his players responded, there will be concern at how much the energy-sapping 120 minutes has taken out of them. Chelsea do not have long to recover from going out of Europe as they prepare to make a second visit of the season to Wembley. They face Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST) - a competition that offers them their last chance of landing a major domestic trophy.  Despite enjoying success in the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup, they lost a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in the Premier League with just eight matches left.

I think if you love football, you love watching the best teams - with the best players and best managers - going head to head on big occasions like these, with all the quality and intensity on the pitch and the pressure that comes with it. It is the little details that will decide the big moments when two wonderful sides like Liverpool and City meet. You want games like that to be settled by a bit of genius but it could be a tiny mistake - one person switching off and losing concentration on a set-play at the wrong time. Right now, Liverpool just seem less likely to do that. Jurgen Klopp's side know how to get the job done when they don't play well, which is a knack City have not had in recent weeks, helped by the fact the Reds are not conceding goals at the moment.  Part of that is because they have got a brilliant goalkeeper in Alisson who is on the top of his game, and some quality defenders too, but it's also because they are on a run where it must feel like everything is going their way. I've been there, when you know you are getting the rub of the green in games because you see the opposition miss big chances or decisions go your way, but then you go on and win. We saw that happen for Liverpool against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Sunday and, for their players, it will just add to the feeling that it is their time. That's how I'd describe the way Liverpool are looking, more than City anyway. Liverpool have already got the momentum from cutting their deficit to City in the league from 14 points on 15 January to one point now, and they are also in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and have got a favourable draw against Benfica in the last eight of the Champions League. The confidence around Anfield must be phenomenal. The FA Cup semi-final will carry the least pressure for both teams, but it will be treated differently in terms of selection too. Liverpool have already won a domestic cup this year, and City have won plenty of them in the past few seasons so I think, right now, both teams would agree that trophy is the least important of the three. The other two competitions are the big ones, and my gut feeling is they will win one each. For some reason, and I don't exactly know why, I think Liverpool will win the Premier League. That game at Etihad Stadium is going to be absolutely pivotal in the title race, because whoever is top after that is going to be very hard to catch - I just don't see either team dropping many points elsewhere. It's a big ask for Liverpool to go there and win, because even Klopp has only done that once in the Premier League since 2015, but I just have a feeling the Reds will come out on top. At the same time, I think it's going to be City's year in the Champions League. The general aim when you are talking about tournament football, whether it is elite club competition or at the top end of the international game, is that you want to consistently go deep or go close, time after time. Do that, like City keep doing in Europe, and you will win in the end. If I'm wrong and City end up empty-handed, or Liverpool just win the Carabao Cup, then their seasons would be seen by some as a failure. Not by me, though. For me, a bad season is the one Manchester United could end up with if they finish outside the Champions League places as well as missing out on silverware again. It would be devastating of course but, to use an extreme example, if City or Liverpool finished runners-up in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, to me, that would be close to perfect. For both of them, just getting this far means their squads have been playing at a consistently excellent level for the whole season, and competing at the top of European football and domestically for eight months. So, whatever happens next, it has already been a very good season for Liverpool and City, but it could turn out to be a very special one.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60817143"},
{"title": "Man City: 'A horrible tie to start a huge week' - Micah Richards analysis", "content": "Here we go then. The next 12 days will make or break Manchester City's season - and they face a run of fixtures that I am excited about, but dreading at the same time. Pep Guardiola's side have done brilliantly to get to April and still be in the hunt for the Treble, but all three trophies are on the line in the next four games, against two extremely difficult opponents - Liverpool and Atletico Madrid. Starting on Tuesday evening, City have a horrible sequence of matches in which they play Atletico, Liverpool, Atletico, Liverpool in the Champions League, Premier League and finally the FA Cup. I don't think City will win all four games - they don't have to - but for different reasons they have to go hard in the first two, which are absolutely crucial for what happens next. City have had some kind draws in Europe before. Not this year. Over two legs I fancy them to beat Atletico - they are the favourites, of course - but it will come down to what happens in the first leg of their quarter-final, far more so than if they were playing anyone else. While I'm pleased City are at home first, this is no time to be cagey. They have to really go for it and throw everything at Atletico, which brings its own risks. We know what they are like and what their manager Diego Simeone is going to do. Atletico will come to Etihad Stadium on Tuesday to defend, to be awkward and to frustrate. Pretty much every other away team does that at City anyway, but the difference with Atletico is that they are so good at it, and also very dangerous when they break. If there's any team I wouldn't want to face, it's them.  We saw what they did against Manchester United in the last 16 - they don't want the ball, and they are happy for you to have it, yet on the counter-attack they are lethal. As Tottenham showed a few weeks ago, that is City's one weakness. What is imperative is that City take a lead to Spain, preferably by a couple of goals. If that is the case and Atletico need to come out and attack at Wanda Metropolitano next week, then City will dissect them, no problem.  But if things are still sticky by then, it is going to take an awful lot out of Pep's players to get through - and they might not have much left in the tank. The Premier League title race is now like a knockout competition too - Guardiola was right when he said at the weekend that if City lose, they are out. There will still be seven league games left after they play Liverpool at home on Sunday but, if City lose that one, I believe the title is done. Not because City can't get back into it mathematically, but because of the damage done in the psychological battle. It reminds me of when my City side beat Manchester United at home in April 2012. Vincent Kompany scored the winner and we felt like, no matter what happened, we were going to win the title. Until then, it was still in United's hands and losing that control really hurts. That's why this game is the one that matters for City. From the players' point of view, if they lose at home to Liverpool they will think they have lost the Premier League - whatever other people think. The way City beat Burnley on Saturday, it didn't look like they were feeling the pressure, but of course they are thinking about Liverpool, who have won 10 league games in a row to reduce the gap to one point. You can tell that just from listening to the City players. When they drew with Crystal Palace before the international break, Bernardo Silva was asked about something different and he replied how he'd rather be in City's position than Liverpool's, when no-one had even mentioned Jurgen Klopp's side. So, yes, it is getting to them. They are thinking about Liverpool, although Guardiola might try to deny it.  You always think about your closest rivals anyway, but this time Liverpool are in their heads. The FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool will not just be an afterthought for Guardiola because we know he tries to win every competition. Out of the three, the Premier League is still the biggest prize, because to win that over 38 games shows exactly how good a team you are, and how you have got the consistency you need. But let's not forget what Guardiola really wants here - the Champions League - and City want it too. They have won everything else, but until they land that as well, it will always be a stick to beat them with. That makes Europe the most important thing for City this season, regardless of anything else. Of course they are ready - they've been here before, and have been good enough to win the Champions League for a few years now, long enough to learn the best side don't always win these ties. If they get past Atletico, they certainly won't be scared of the other teams - they just need to find a way of getting over the line this time.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60975903"},

The Champions League quarter-final draw will be at 11:00 GMT, before the semi-final draw and a final 'draw' to see which is the 'home side' for administrative reasons. Manchester United lost to Atletico Madrid in the last 16, but the top three in the Premier League are still in the tournament, along with three sides from Spain, one from Germany and one from Portugal.  Atletico Madrid (Spain), Bayern Munich (Germany), Benfica (Portugal), Chelsea (England), Liverpool (England), Manchester City (England), Real Madrid (Spain), Villarreal (Spain). The first team drawn in each fixture play their home match first with the first legs on 5 and 6 April before the second legs on 12 and 13 April.

In the Europa League, West Ham will play Lyon in their first European quarter-final since 1981.

The draw means Chelsea face a reunion with their former manager Carlo Ancelotti, who won the Premier League and FA Cup double during a two-year spell with the Stamford Bridge club between 2009 and 2011. The Italian is one of only three managers to win the Champions League three times, including with Real in 2014, and returned for a second spell at the Spanish giants last summer after leaving Everton. Chelsea and Real also met at the semi-final stage last season, with Thomas Tuchel's side winning  3-1 on aggregate  before going on to beat Manchester City in the final.

Atletico Madrid have the chance to complete a Manchester double after being drawn against Pep Guardiola's City, with Diego Simeone's side having beaten Manchester United  2-1 on aggregate  in the quarter-finals.  It will be the first competitive meeting between the sides in European competition as City, who thrashed Sporting Lisbon  5-0 on aggregate  to reach this stage, seek a first Champions League title. Liverpool meanwhile have played Portuguese giants Benfica 10 times in Europe, most recently a 5-3 aggregate win in the Europa League quarter-finals in 2010.

Rangers meanwhile face familiar opposition in Braga having beaten the Portuguese side  4-2 on aggregate  in the last 32 of the Europa League in 2020. Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side reached the last eight thanks to a  4-2 aggregate win  against Red Star Belgrade of Serbia. Should West Ham reach the semi-finals they could meet Barcelona if the Catalan giants overcome Eintracht Frankfurt, while Rangers will face either German club RB Leipzig or Atalanta of Italy if they reach the last four.

The Spanish side did not have a shot on target before substitute Gerard Moreno converted a 78th-minute penalty after Daniele Rugani fouled Francis Coquelin. Defender Pau Torres added a second when he finished from six yards as Juventus failed to deal with a corner. Arnaud Danjuma made it 3-0 with another penalty after Matthijs De Ligt handled. \"We had a gameplan and knew there'd be tough moments,\" said Villarreal boss Unai Emery. \"Whoever we get in the draw will be a top side, just like the one we faced.\" The draw for the quarter-finals takes place on Friday at 11:00 GMT and Villarreal will be in the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2008-09 and only the third time in their history. Following a 1-1 draw in Spain last week, two-time European champions Juventus were clear favourites to advance and they dominated the first half at the Allianz Stadium. However, Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic, a goalscorer in the first leg, hit the crossbar and was also twice denied by Villarreal goalkeeper Gero Rulli, who also saved an effort from ex-Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata. Villarreal, managed by former Arsenal boss Emery, had to defend deep and in numbers for the majority of the second half. However, in a rare attack, substitue Coquelin was fouled by Rugani with referee Szymon Marciniak awarding the penalty after watching it on a pitchside monitor. Moreno, only on the pitch for four minutes, kept his cool to put his side ahead as home goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny got both hands to the shot but could not keep it out. Juventus had been eliminated at this phase of the competition in both the past two years, going out to Lyon in 2020 and Porto in 2021, and fell apart in the last 10 minutes. Terrible defending from a corner allowed Torres to double Villarreal's advantage before former Bournemouth striker Danjuma converted another spot-kick in injury time. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said: \"I think the team played well for over 75 minutes. \"In the second half, Villarreal decided to just defend and block but they had one chance and they took it. Football is like that: one episode can change everything. \"Villarreal defended with 11 men, clearly trying to bring the game to extra time. Then that goal changed everything.\" Villarreal, seventh in La Liga, had qualified for the Champions League courtesy of winning last season's Europa League final - beating Manchester United 11-10 in an epic penalty shootout as United goalkeeper David de Gea missed the decisive penalty.

{"title": "'Manchester City get their hands dirty and find a way to edge Atletico Madrid'", "content": "Manchester City's quarter-final against Atletico Madrid had been portrayed as a meeting between the beauty and the beast of the Champions League.  Pep Guardiola's purists were in opposition to Diego Simeone's arch-pragmatists, conquerors of Liverpool when they held the crown and a frustrated Manchester United in the last round of this season's competition.  It was a scenario that needed beauty to get its hands dirty because breaking down Atletico requires patience, persistence and fierce self-discipline bolted on to the sort of brilliance Phil Foden and Kevin de Bruyne applied to produce the most decisive moment in a game of fine margins.  With frustration mounting inside Etihad Stadium and Atletico's belief growing that they would have something tangible to take back to the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid in eight days, Guardiola made the changes that brought rewards.  Manchester City's manager joked about accusations he is guilty of \"over-thinking\" in the Champions League in the build-up and there was some surprise he left Foden on the bench.  When City needed the magic touch, he introduced the 21-year-old and 79 seconds later the breakthrough came as Foden moved forward, then showed a touch of genius to slip a pass between the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to do the rest.  The Etihad was awash with joy after the tension, Guardiola leading the celebrations with a frantic fist pump towards joyous supporters before sending his water bottle flying with a flourish.  It showed the worth of this slender advantage and just how much any sort of lead and victory means against the masters of making like difficult. Atletico offered their usual diligent defence, the occasional darks arts and the sort of game management that even brought warnings for time wasting in the first half.  Simeone's style is not to everyone's taste. City were the light to Atletico's shade but no-one should doubt the work which goes into playing the way that has been the hallmark of La Liga's champions.  Atletico have quality, discipline and the nerve to back themselves to keep out the best attacks. The fact it was so difficult would not have come as a surprise to Guardiola. He will have seen it employed, with success, by the enigmatic Argentine for years.  Simeone will have spent endless hours on the training ground drilling his team to play in such a fashion, which is why elite managers such as Guardiola express unbounded joy when they can navigate a route around it. City enjoyed 71% possession but most of the time Atletico were happy to let them have it.  The technical area was pure theatre. Guardiola implored his players, directing traffic with extravagant gestures, getting involved in a heated debate with John Stones after one moment that displeased the manager.  Simeone, clad in black as ever, played the role of villain to the soundtrack of disgruntled City fans behind him. He raged to the skies as the Manchester rain poured down, berated officials, concluding his night by racing down the touchline to get involved in an injury-time fracas out of nothing. Classic Diego.  City's lead may only be narrow, the outstretched foot of Stefan Savic stopping De Bruyne doubling it after more Foden brilliance, but you suspect Guardiola would have signed up straight away had he been offered it before the game.  Will it be enough?  City will certainly be happy to take a lead to Spain but they will note the warnings, even only in moments, from Joao Felix and Antoine Griezmann. Luis Suarez was on the bench as further proof Simeone does have the ability to show an attacking side should he choose.  Atletico will believe they can still overcome City, who have shown vulnerability away from home in the Champions League in the past, but the key factor may be that the onus is now on Simeone's team to take a chance or two given they are behind. It is a situation that may suit City's array of attacking riches more than having to hammer away at the red and white wall at the Etihad.  It cannot all be about the beauty of City, on show so often as teams are swept away in the Premier League and in Europe. Sometimes you have to find a different way and Atletico are the team that force you to dig it out.  City uncovered it after 70 minutes to start what could prove to be the pivotal fortnight in their season in exactly the fashion they would have hoped for.  Liverpool come to the Etihad,  fresh from their own emphatic Champions League triumph  against Benfica in Lisbon, for the game many believe will be a title decider on Sunday, followed by the second leg of this tie before another meeting with Jurgen Klopp's side in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.  This was dirty work - but Pep Guardiola will be elated by Manchester City's willingness to do it. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61005123"},
{"title": "Benfica v Liverpool: How Portuguese club overcame internal unrest to reach Champions League quarter-finals", "content": "\"We should be focusing on the derby, not wasting time with this,\" Benfica's players insisted. It was late December and manager Jorge Jesus had gathered his squad to discuss things that had been said in the dressing room following the 3-0 defeat by Porto in the Portuguese Cup. Jesus had missed that game because of suspension, but was told that one of the team's captains, Pizzi, had insulted him and so asked the veteran midfielder to repeat what he had said, word for word. Pizzi denied having offended him. Jesus didn't believe it and announced the midfielder would no longer be training with the first team. As the 67-year-old coach left the room, the rest of the squad talked for a minute and came to a quick decision: if Pizzi was left out of the session, they wouldn't train either. There was no turning back - it was Jesus versus the players. Within 48 hours Jesus was on his way out of the Portuguese giants. It could have been a turning point for them - it wasn't. A day later Benfica played Porto again, and were only four points behind their northern rivals back then. As they prepare to host Liverpool on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-finals, they are 15 points off the top and out of the league title race for another year. It comes as no surprise, though, that a season which started with Luis Filipe Vieira - club president since 2003 -  being put under house arrest  has come to this. He subsequently resigned for alleged tax fraud and money laundering, though as yet there has been no conviction and his lawyers deny the allegations. The question being asked now is a different one: how on earth has a team that went through all this and couldn't even beat the likes of Vizela and Gil Vicente come so far in the Champions League? Over the past few months, leaked conversations revealing, for instance, that Jose Mourinho pushed for Benfica to appoint Laurent Blanc instead of Jesus as manager have  made the headlines  nearly every day in Portugal. They are part of audio recordings made by public prosecutors while investigating Vieira and his closest partners, and have disclosed much of the club's business. With so much off-the-pitch noise, it's hard to think of a scenario where Benfica could have stayed focused on football. \"It's only natural that the players end up being affected by it, too,\" former Benfica, Tottenham and Portsmouth centre-back Ricardo Rocha told BBC Sport. \"Although many of these problems are not game related, they certainly make it much more complicated for the team to achieve its goals. And this is a team that is expected to fight for every trophy. But then again, it's much more difficult to do that when you have so much trouble surrounding the club structure. \"They've had presidential elections, a new president [Portugal legend Rui Costa] and a new coach [Nelson Verissimo, who was previously in charge of the reserves]. These things obviously affect your daily routine and this is clear by the way the team has been performing in the Portuguese league - they are not in the position they wanted. \"Since Verissimo took over, however, he has managed to unite the players and, having reached the quarter-finals in the Champions League, it's now the time for them to get rid of any pressure and play their football against Liverpool.\" While struggling for most of the domestic season, Benfica's best moments have come in the Champions League: beating PSV Eindhoven in the play-offs, Barcelona in the group stage and  Ajax in the last 16 . It's much more than they could have hoped for, but they want to keep their European adventure going. If they do so, they will have emulated Rocha and his team-mates, who caused a major upset by  knocking Liverpool out of the Champions League last 16  in 2006. \"I'd say Liverpool are even stronger now, but back then they were the title holders and also a very difficult side to play against,\" Rocha said. \"It didn't stop us from believing we could still go ahead and so we went on to beat them in both matches. This is the mentality for games like these.\" Throughout this campaign, Benfica have looked far more comfortable defending compared with when they have had to take control of games. Perhaps that is key to understanding why they find themselves among Europe's eight best clubs, but couldn't impose themselves against Braga in the league on Friday, losing 3-2. Benfica must \"expose Liverpool's weak points\" on Tuesday night, said Rocha, and that top scorer Darwin Nunez - with 27 goals and three assists this season - and defensive duo Jan Vertonghen and Nicolas Otamendi will be \"absolutely crucial\" for them. \"The whole team will have to be at their level if they are to keep dreaming,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60980975"},

Tuchel said he was disappointed Szymon Marciniak appeared to be having \"a good time with Carlo\" at the final whistle. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, the Blues forced extra time against the record 13-time winners at the Bernabeu before losing 5-4 on aggregate. \"I think this is the very, very worst time to do this,\" said Tuchel. \"After 126 minutes with one team giving their heart and desire, fighting to the very last drop. \"I know Carlo is a gentleman and a nice guy but when I wanted to go and say thank you [to the referee] I see him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponent coach. \"I think it's very, very bad timing.\" Tuchel was also unhappy the official did not check the VAR monitor himself when a Marcos Alonso effort was disallowed for handball in the second half. \"If you play against Real Madrid you can maybe not expect everybody has the courage. I felt little decisions went against us also in the first leg and today as well,\" he said. \"I did not see the goal but I told him I'm super disappointed he didn't go to check it himself. You should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair and isolated from the atmosphere. \"A referee has a certain style, things he allows and doesn't allow, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own, then he could explain it better. \"But this is just my opinion. Maybe it's too much to ask for in matches like this against this opponent.\" Tuchel said there were \"no regrets\" despite Chelsea's elimination after coming close to what would have been a stunning comeback. Many had written off Chelsea's chances, but when Timo Werner scored to make it 3-0 on the night in the 75th minute, the Blues were 15 minutes away from a sensational feat. However, Rodrygo's volley brought the scores back level on aggregate five minutes later before Karim Benzema - a hat-trick hero at Stamford Bridge six days earlier - headed the decisive goal which sent Real through. \"These are the kind of defeats we can digest and swallow as we left nothing to regret out there,\" said Tuchel. \"It was not meant to be. We were simply unlucky.\" \"We showed the quality and character this team has and deserved to go through. There is nothing to regret.\" However, the Chelsea boss was critical of the mistakes over two legs which led to Real's goals. Benzema's extra-time goal came after Antonio Rudiger slipped in the box. \"We had a huge deficit to overcome because we did big mistakes in the first leg and today both goals come from mistakes from us,\" added Tuchel. \"They took advantage of the mistakes with individual quality and that was enough because over the two legs we did too many of these big mistakes.\" Chelsea do not have long to recover from going out of Europe as they prepare to make a second visit of the season to Wembley. They face Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday (16:30 BST) - a competition that offers them their last chance of landing a major domestic trophy.  Despite enjoying success in the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup, they lost a penalty shootout to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final and are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in the Premier League with just eight matches left. \"The positive is we didn't give up,\" said defender Rudiger. \"Not many teams can come and dominate Real Madrid as we did. But over the two legs if you make these kind of mistakes like we did, you get punished. \"It was a do or die for us. I think before the game not everybody thought we would have the 3-0. For them the individual class comes to light with Luka Modric and Benzema.\" Former England keeper   is worried the energy-sapping 120 minutes in Spain's capital could take its toll on Chelsea as they prepare for Wembley. \"Chelsea invested so much in the game. They put hearts and souls into this game,\" Green, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said. \"Real Madrid looked lost. They looked like they didn't have a clue, like they were short of confidence. But they have players who produce moments.\" Former England midfielder   speaking on 5 Live, added: \"You can't complain. This leg wasn't the one that sent Chelsea out.  \"They have conceded five goals over the two legs. Last season they were built on defence. You have to have a clean-sheet mentality.

Cas granted the request for security reasons given the potentially \"serious repercussions\" of trying to exclude 5,000 ticket holders from attending the match at such short notice. In a statement Atletico said \"all members and fans with a season ticket or seat\" could attend the game.

{"title": "Benfica 1-3 Liverpool: Reds in control of Champions League quarter-final", "content": "1446 Liverpool will take a two-goal lead into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp says his side are \"not in dreamland\" after an important victory over Benfica in Lisbon.  Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos. Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half. The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest.  But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments. \"Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,\" said Klopp. \"We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here. \"It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica.\" This was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later. The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be \"outstanding\".  Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go.  Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout.  He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half.  Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club. The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish.  Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season.  That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away. But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

{"title": "Manchester City 1-0 Atletico Madrid: Kevin de Bruyne goal gives hosts a slender lead", "content": "927 Kevin de Bruyne's second-half goal gave Manchester City victory as they overcame Atletico Madrid's typically fierce resistance in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Etihad Stadium.  Diego Simeone's side performed with their trademark defensive discipline, restricting City to very few opportunities until De Bruyne pounced to make the breakthrough with 20 minutes left.  Phil Foden, on as a substitute, produced the moment of magic to unlock Atletico with a perfect pass through the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to slot past goalkeeper Jan Oblak.  It was the decisive moment in the tightest of games but City manager Pep Guardiola's wild celebration illustrated just how much it means to take a lead, even if slender, to Madrid for the second leg on 13 April.  It was clear from the opening moments this was going to be a night for patience from City as Atletico, to no-one's great surprise, strung a bank of five defenders across the pitch and invited Guardiola's side to break them down.  For the first 45 minutes it worked to perfection as the hosts barely laid a glove on the Spanish champions, who protected keeper Oblak with the diligence and desire Simeone demands.  It was actually Atletico who threatened with a couple of breaks early in the second half, but City eventually managed to impose themselves and become more of a threat.  De Bruyne saw a free-kick well saved by Oblak and Aymeric Laporte headed over from a good position following a corner. But it was the introduction of Foden that finally allowed City to spread some stardust on proceedings.  He showed glorious control and vision to nutmeg Reinildo, allowing De Bruyne to fire low past Oblak to ignite what had been a tense, largely subdued atmosphere inside Etihad Stadium.  City could not add a second with De Bruyne denied by a block on the line from Stefan Savic, but any lead is precious against an Atletico side who have made a speciality of frustrating Premier League giants in the past. Liverpool found that out in 2020 when they lost both legs as holders in the last 16, while Manchester United were also eliminated at the same stage this season.  \"We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face, but it is a good result,\" said Guardiola. \"We had chances to score a second and third. It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try to win again.\" Simeone marched off in defiant fashion at the final whistle and the Argentine will rightly feel Atletico are still in this tie - it would be folly to dismiss Simeone or his durable Champions League campaigners.  The onus though, is now on them to attack in the return leg.  \"It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win,\" Simeone said.  \"It is clear we were playing against an extraordinary opponent. The numbers and statistics speak for themselves and they play in a very dynamic way. We had to suffer but we have to go to Madrid now and use the tools we have at our disposal. \"We need to be better but we are still in the tie. Let's see if we can have the ball more in the second leg and create more difficulties for our opponents but that comes with being calm and having the collective defensive effort.\" However, alterations to Atletico's approach may well suit City more than having to break down the red and white wall of resistance that made their lives so difficult until that important De Bruyne strike on his 50th Champions League appearance for the club.

{"title": "Ukraine crisis: Uefa likely to move Champions League final from St Petersburg in Russia", "content": "Uefa is almost certain to switch this season's Champions League final away from St Petersburg amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Russia has  ordered troops into two rebel-held regions  of Ukraine and there are fears an invasion is planned. Several countries,  including the UK,  have introduced sanctions against Russia in response to the move. Uefa said it was \"closely monitoring the situation\" and \"any decision would be made in due course if necessary\". Against the backdrop of unrest, Uefa is viewed as being highly unlikely to attempt to host the game in Russia. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, said there was \"no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries\". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries added  that she had \"serious concerns about the sporting events due to be held in Russia, such as the Champions League final, and will discuss with the relevant governing bodies\". She added: \"We won't allow [Russia] President [Vladimir] Putin to exploit events on the world stage to legitimise his illegal invasion of Ukraine.\" Meanwhile, former UK sports minister Tracey Crouch has told BBC Sport that Uefa should move the final \"immediately\". European football's governing body is assessing the situation before making a decision but it is set to be looking for a new venue at short notice for the third year running. The past two Champions League finals were played in Portugal because of Covid-19 related issues. BBC Sport understands the game will still be played on Saturday, 28 May, which is likely to rule Wembley out as a host as the League Two and Championship play-off finals are set to be played at the stadium over that weekend.  Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said other venues in the British capital should be considered as he called for \"a comprehensive package of sanctions against Russia\" to be imposed. \"Hosting games should be a privilege not a right, I think the final should be taken away from St Petersburg and London stands ready to host the final,\" he told BBC London. Uefa has already postponed the Youth League last-16 tie between Dynamo Kyiv and Sporting Lisbon which was scheduled to be played in the Ukraine capital on 2 March.  The match has been moved to 9 March, with Uefa saying they will remain \"in contact with the two clubs for any further decision\". Other Uefa competition fixtures may yet need to be moved. There are no teams from Ukraine left in any other European competition this season but Russian club Zenit St Petersburg are still in the Europa League and are set to play the second leg of their play-off round tie with Real Betis in Spain on Thursday. Zenit lost the home leg 3-2. At international level, Russia are scheduled to host Poland in a World Cup play-off on 24 March and - if they win - would face Sweden or Czech Republic on 29 March. Ukraine are also in the World Cup play-offs, and visit Scotland and then either Wales or Austria in their bid to qualify for the tournament in Qatar. Tensions in the region have escalated further this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering troops into two rebel-held regions in eastern Ukraine, after recognising them as independent states. Fears over an invasion have been rising in recent months, as Russia has massed around 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders, according to US estimates. \"Given the British and European condemnation of Russian action in Ukraine, Uefa should immediately move the Champions League final from the Gazprom stadium,\" added Crouch. \"The ban on politicians and officials travelling to the Russian-hosted 2018 World Cup was a soft message to President Putin which made no significant difference - so Uefa need to take a much stronger stance not least to ensure the safety of travelling fans.\" St Petersburg was used as a venue for a number of matches at last summer's delayed Euro 2020 tournament. On Tuesday night Manchester City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko said \"no-one will ever be able to appropriate\" Ukraine. The 25-year-old, who has 48 international caps for Ukraine,  wrote on Instagram:  \"The whole civilized world is worried about the situation in my country. I can't stay away and try to convey my opinion. The country where I was born and raised. A country whose colours I defend in the international sports arena. A country that we try to glorify and develop. A country whose borders must remain inviolable.  \"My country belongs to Ukrainians and no-one will ever be able to appropriate it. We will not give up!

{"title": "Jonathan David: Lille striker faces Chelsea with Europe's biggest clubs watching", "content": "Jonathan David's personality is as unassuming as the route he took into professional football. While he is not one to shout about himself, the 22-year-old Canada striker has taken the many challenges he has faced in his career in his stride. Born in New York, David moved to Haiti aged three before his parents emigrated to Ottawa three years later. There, he made the first of several good decisions when he joined local club Ottawa Gloucester Hornets at the age of nine. There was no meticulous development at an academy of a Major League Soccer team, despite there being interest from all three in Canada. He stayed with the club until he was 16 despite being courted by Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps and Montreal Impact. After seven years with the Hornets he then took a giant leap, crossing the Atlantic to join Belgian club Gent. He impressed there, leading to a move to upwardly mobile French club Lille in 2020. His rise has continued in Ligue 1, where he is established as one of the most dangerous forwards in the country. So, when he faces Chelsea in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, he will do so as a striker who is attracting attention from some of the continent's biggest clubs. Facing the reigning European champions is another step in David's seemingly inexorable rise to the very top, and while he shows none of the brashness that sometimes surrounds elite players, he does not lack self-belief. He never has. The shy youngster was telling his youth coaches from an early age that he intended to play in Europe. Even that confident young striker might have been pleasantly surprised had he been told back then that he was going to play a key part in winning one of the continent's major league titles so early in his career. That's exactly what he did last season though, his 13 goals helping Lille to a first Ligue 1 title in a decade - and beating star-studded, big-spending Paris St-Germain in the process. \"He was a shy boy but on the pitch he'd just score goals,\" says Hornets technical director Jay DaCosta. \"His ability is natural; he finds room and puts the ball in the back of the net. \"His plan was always to go to Europe. The Canadian MLS sides all wanted him but it is testament to his mentality that he took that path. If it was me, I'd have signed one of those contracts because I know the environment those clubs have, but he stayed local and worked on his game. \"He's made really good decisions in his career. Picking Belgium, a league where he'd get playing time and they develop young players, and the same with Lille.  \"It came out of nowhere that he was going. Normally the route is an MLS academy and you build from there; that is what we were expecting. When some kid from Ottawa tells you he's going to play in Europe, it's like 'yeah, yeah sure you are', but he did it.\" Scoring 12 more goals this season has cemented his status as one of European football's most coveted young players. Soon, though, he may be excelling not just on the European club stage, but on the global one. Canada's drive towards their second World Cup appearance has centred around the talents of David and Bayern Munich defender Alphonso Davies, who have thrived under English manager John Herdman. After beating the United States in the recent international window, Canada are now heavy favourites to qualify for Qatar, giving David a whole new platform to demonstrate his talents. Former Scotland defender Steven Caldwell was on Canada's coaching staff until last year, and he says David can go right to the top. \"Jonny is pretty special and I think he can play for any team in the world,\" Caldwell says. \"He's a great defensive centre forward; he's really smart and takes good lines of pressure, cuts off easy passes into midfield. He will make life difficult for [N'Golo] Kante, Jorginho or [Mateo] Kovacic. \"But he's got great composure and he's deceptively quick. He eats up the ground; he's very good at everything but has a lot to improve on, which is crazy. \"He's strong-minded and very focused; he backs himself and he's grown in the time I've known him, but he's never really changed. That's rare when you move to a different country so young. \"He puts on a game face; he's a cold assassin and very clinical.\" Canada's World Cup qualification form has changed how football is viewed in the country.  The Hornets have benefitted from that, according to DaCosta, and were also able to stay afloat during lockdown thanks to sell-on clauses in his contracts with Gent and Lille. \"We have pictures of him all over our clubhouse and he's on the front page of our website, because to me there is nothing more inspiring for a young player than to read about this kid, especially the route he took,\" says DaCosta. \"We post about him on social media a lot and he was over here during the Christmas break; he worked with a couple of local teams and kids, which is amazing. \"Through Covid we struggled with shutdowns, but the Jonathan David money has helped immensely to keep our community club going.\" With Lille struggling to replicate last season's feats and sitting mid-table despite David's form, there is regular talk about a move to one of Europe's most prestigious clubs.  \"We are desperate to watch him face a Premier League team because that is mainly what we watch here,\" he adds. \"Chelsea are European champions, so if he can impress against them, his stock will rise. You'd anticipate everyone will be interested, but his choices have been calculated, centred around his development.\" \"He's ruthless, but the Premier League is a different beast,\" Caldwell concludes. \"Working under a top manager, he could really improve. No disrespect to Lille, but he's very defensive in that team and plays on the counter attack; I'm looking forward to seeing him in a team with lots of possession.  \"If he's at the right price, I can see him at Liverpool or Manchester City.\" Chelsea may be overwhelming favourites for the tie but they can expect Lille's not-so-secret weapon to cause them problems.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60446193"},

Salzburg substitute Chukwubuike Adamu had netted the opener with a delightful curling finish into the corner. The hosts could have nicked a second at 1-0, but Karim Adeyemi's shot was saved and Adamu's follow-up was blocked. The vibrant home side were appearing in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time, but did not look out of place against an often flat Bayern side. The Bundesliga champions suffered a stunning 4-2 home loss against Bochum at the weekend and avoided back-to-back defeats for the first time since 2019. Julian Nagelsmann's side cruised through the group stage by winning all six games, but found it difficult to deal with the youthfulness and pace of their opponents. Salzburg, fielding the youngest average starting side in the Champions League since Ajax in 2003, took the lead on 21 minutes through Adamu's lovely effort. Brenden Aaronson cut onto his left and forced a smart save from Sven Ulreich, while Germany international Adeyemi's effort was straight at the Bayern understudy keeper.

{"title": "Chelsea 2-0 Lille: Champions League title holders take command of last-16 tie with first-leg win", "content": "393 Chelsea took control of their Champions League last-16 tie against Lille with a comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge.  Kai Havertz headed in Hakim Ziyech's corner after eight minutes and Christian Pulisic was the beneficiary of a superb run and pass from N'Golo Kante in the 63rd minute as the Blues secured a crucial first-leg advantage.  Out-of-sorts striker Romelu Lukaku was only a substitute, with Havertz the main attacking threat - and the German almost scoring twice before his early strike.  The only negatives on a good night for Chelsea and manager Thomas Tuchel were injuries to Ziyech and midfielder Mateo Kovacic ahead of Sunday's EFL Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.  \"I should have subbed Mateo at half-time,\" Tuchel told BT Sport. \"I have not spoken to the doctor about Hakim and hope it is not serious. Today is Tuesday, there are a lot of days to recover until Sunday. I hope they will be ready for Sunday.\" Chelsea had few alarms against a spirited Lille side, with their composed and professional performance summed up by the quality shown by veteran defender Thiago Silva and outstanding midfield man Kante.  Silva made a mockery of his 37 years with a peerless performance, spending most of the night in cruise control, displaying experience and perfect positioning to snuff out any moments of danger.  The Brazilian also has a turn of pace when required and is such a consummate performer that he is a cult figure among Chelsea fans, who chanted his name throughout. Silva is a defender and leader of the highest class, who appears to improve with age.  A further bonus for boss Tuchel was the return of Kante to prime form, plugging gaps and starting attacks all over the pitch - perpetual motion at all times and a crucial component in his side's engine room.  There was no better illustration of what Kante brings to Chelsea than the surging run and perfect pass to Pulisic, that allowed the forward to lift a finish over the onrushing Lille keeper Leo Jardim for a second goal that may yet prove decisive in pursuit of a place in the last eight.  Tuchel will be concerned Kante's midfield partner Kovacic failed to shake off a knock he sustained in the first half - and Ziyech limped off too. But there was plenty to be satisfied about as Chelsea look to retain the crown they won against Manchester City in Porto last June.  Chelsea's £97.5m record signing Lukaku was the man in the spotlight after his lack of impact at Crystal Palace on Saturday. He touched the ball only seven times in that 1-0 win, one of which was the kick-off - the lowest tally for a player completing a full 90 minutes in the Premier League since stats started being recorded in 2003-04.  It compounded the sense of unease surrounding the striker's status at Stamford Bridge and he started this tie on the bench, when this was presumably the sort of occasion he was bought for when Chelsea parted with that amount to Inter Milan.  Havertz stepped into the breach as Chelsea's attacking spearhead and the languid 22-year-old did the job by giving a perfectly rounded performance, as well as setting them on their way with that early header.  The German should have opened his account in the opening moments when he turned Cesar Azpilicueta's cross over the top from only six yards and then forced Jardim into a fine save.  But Havertz made sure he was on the end of Ziyech's resulting corner with a downward header and the man who scored the winner in last season's final proved to be Chelsea's Champions League talisman once more.  Even when Tuchel made a change up front late on, it was not Lukaku who was called upon, but Timo Werner for goalscorer Pulisic. This was a very satisfactory night for Chelsea and their manager, but the conundrum surrounding Lukaku will not go away until the striker, who has had an unsettled season so far, starts producing. Many believed he was going to provide the cutting edge to their frontline and add the finishing touch to last season's Champions League-winning side. Lukaku's chance may come against Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday, but Tuchel went here with the more complete game and goal threat of Havertz - and felt the benefit as Chelsea are now in pole position to reach the quarter-finals.

The final of Europe's most prestigious club competition was due to be played in St Petersburg on 28 May. Meanwhile, Russia's Formula 1 Grand Prix, due to take place in Sochi in September,  has been cancelled. F1 says it is \"impossible\" to hold the event in \"the current circumstances\". International sports federations should move or cancel their sports events currently planned in Russia or Belarus, says the International Olympic Committee. Uefa said the Champions League final would not be held at the Gazprom Arena and would move to the Stade de France in Paris instead. Uefa thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for \"his personal support and commitment\" to have the game moved to France at \"a time of unparalleled crisis\". It added: \"Together with the French government, Uefa will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.\" It is the third year running the venue of the Champions League final has been moved - the previous two due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to strip St Petersburg of the final has been criticised by Russian sporting and political officials. Manchester United interim manager  , whose side are in the Champions League last 16, said it was \"inevitable\" and the \"right\" decision. Chelsea boss  , who led the club owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to last season's Champions League title, agreed.  \"Sadly I think it's the worst reason to change location. This is not good news but it had to happen. There are things more important [than football],\" said the German. While expressing his sorrow at the situation, Paris St-Germain coach   said the final being held in the French capital would provide \"extra motivation\" in the club's bid to become European champions for the first time. Russian Football Union (RFU) president   who serves on the Uefa executive committee and is the chief executive of Gazprom subsidiary Gazprom Neft, said he \"could not support\" the move. \"We believe the decision was dictated by political reasons. The RFU has always adhered to the principle of 'sport is out of politics',\" he said. Kremlin spokesman   added: \"It's a shame that such a decision has been made. St Petersburg could have provided all favourable conditions to hold this festival of soccer.\" However, UK Culture Secretary   welcomed \"decisive action\" by Uefa. Labour's   the shadow culture secretary, agreed it was a \"welcome step\".  At its emergency meeting on Friday, Uefa also ordered Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams to play their home matches away from the region \"until further notice\". Spartak Moscow are the only Russian team left in European club competition this season and have been drawn against German side RB Leipzig in the last 16 of the Europa League. That decision was also criticised by Russian football's president Alexander Dyukov as \"violating the sports principle and infringing on the interests of players, coaches and fans\". Russia and Ukraine are both scheduled to play 2022 men's World Cup play-off matches in March, with world governing body Fifa saying on Thursday it was monitoring the situation in the region. Russia are due to host Poland in Moscow on 24 March, while Ukraine travel to Scotland on the same day.  In the statement announcing its decisions, Uefa did not mention its long-term relationship with Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom. Gazprom is one of Uefa's major sponsors in a deal worth about £30m each year. But BBC Sport understands Uefa is taking legal advice as it looks at ways to end the association, which began in 2012, after recognising the concerns around the company. As well as holding the naming rights for St Petersburg's 68,000-capacity stadium, Gazprom is also the main sponsor of German club Schalke. Schalke announced on Thursday the logo of the company would be removed from the club's shirts. Alex Phillips, a former Uefa executive and now an independent adviser to Fifa, said Uefa will have to \"seriously revise who they accept sponsorships with\". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"When I was at Uefa I was head of compliance and I wrote a series of regulations recommending that this sort of relationship should be, at the very least, out in the open and regulated.\" ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60520933"},
{"title": "Atletico Madrid 1-1 Manchester United: Anthony Elanga's late goal boost visitors' hopes of Champions League progression", "content": "1378 Anthony Elanga says he has \"dreamt of moments\" like his late equaliser in the the first leg of Manchester United's Champions League last-16 draw at Atletico Madrid. The 19-year-old had been on the pitch less than six minutes after replacing Marcus Rashford, when he raced onto Bruno Fernandes' perfectly-weighted pass to roll the ball past home goalkeeper Jan Oblak with his first touch to earn his side a 1-1 draw. \"I told you how calm and cool I am and whenever I am given a opportunity. I want to repay the manager and give 150% every time I step onto the pitch,\" Elanga told BT Sport.  \"I just do what I can do, I want to be the best player on the pitch and I appreciate the boss. \"He [Ralf Rangnick] said to me to make the defenders scared and run in behind when I get the opportunity. \"I have dreamt of moments like this, scoring in the Champions League against top European teams like Atletico Madrid, [it is] a dream come true.\" Until that point it appeared as though Diego Simeone's Spanish champions were going to take a narrow advantage to Old Trafford after delivering a masterclass in controlling the game without the ball. Joao Felix's early header from Renan Lodi's inviting cross gave the hosts a dream start with United looking ragged on their right, where interim boss Rangnick's deployment of Victor Lindelof at full-back failed badly.  Rangnick later conceded that his plan \"was in the dustbin\" after seven minutes with the Swedish central defender, who was uncomfortable throughout, being booked for a tug on Felix before his second-half withdrawal. By then Atletico should have been two goals ahead with Sime Vrsaljko heading the ball off Lindelof and onto the United bar in the closing moments of the first half after some more dismal defending.  While Rangnick's side enjoyed plenty of the ball, they were slow and indecisive in possession and barely looked capable of carving open their well-drilled opponents who repeatedly picked off every sloppy United pass in midfield. Atletico were also unlucky to not score late on themselves when Antoine Griezmann rattled the visitors crossbar. However, Elanga, who missed the crucial penalty when Rangnick's side lost in the FA Cup to Middlesbrough earlier this month, followed up his goal at Leeds on Sunday with another important intervention to change the complexion of the tie before the second leg in Manchester in three weeks time. \"He is playing as though it is a dream come true,\" Rangnick added. \"It is a joy and fun to watch him play, I wish a few other players would take him as an example and as a role model.\" For long periods of this encounter United served up the sort of fare that has typified Rangnick's three-month reign as boss.  Disjointed in possession, misplaced and overhit passes were produced with alarming frequency as Fred, Paul Pogba and Fernandes failed to impose themselves on the game and the athleticism of Scott McTominay was sorely missed in midfield.  There were also several elementary mistakes at the back, such as Fred's charge out towards the ball and the lack of communication as Felix stole past Harry Maguire to head the opening goal.  Lindelof's unfamiliarity with his adopted position hardly helped and it was notable that United's main improvement came after the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Alex Telles and Elanga were introduced.  Elanga in particular provided the pace to run in behind - an option that had barely been utilised with the visitors until then. And it reaped immediate dividends, with the Sweden under-21 international registering United's first shot on target with his goal to become the club's youngest goalscorer in the knockout stages of the Champions League. \"It was exactly what I have been saying [all night]. Elanga has come on and made runs off the ball and probably for the first time all evening long Bruno Fernandes gets his pass right. \"For 75 minutes of this game you felt that Manchester United would have been happy to take a 2-0 defeat back to Old Trafford but they hung in there and those substitutions gave them that bit more control and Elanga got the goal.\"  \"Man United would have taken your hand off for that result. They were lucky tonight and were poor tonight.  \"David de Gea did not have much to do [but] you are looking for a better performance.\"  \"Ralf Rangnick's record is very good and his subs have been very good. It is not strange for me, it is a typical Manchester United performance under this manager.\"  \"Anthony Elanga gave them some urgency, young kids are fearless and he galvanised United. They will be delighted by that result, they were not great today.\"  Formation    3-5-2 Formation    4-2-3-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60482881"},

{"title": "Inter Milan 0-2 Liverpool: Reds score two late goals to take control of last-16 tie", "content": "2257 Liverpool took a huge step towards the Champions League quarter-finals after scoring two late goals against Inter Milan in the San Siro. The Reds looked set for a goalless draw in the first leg in Italy until Brazil forward Roberto Firmino got on the end of Andrew Robertson's corner to head his side into the lead. Mohamed Salah added a second with a deflected effort from inside the box which means Jurgen Klopp's side take a sizeable advantage into the second leg at Anfield on 8 March. Italian champions Inter hit the bar through Hakan Calhanoglu and were on top for long periods of the second half before Firmino struck in the 75th minute. Liverpool scored from their only two attempts on target and will be firm favourites to progress when the two sides meet in the deciding leg next month. It was a particularly memorable night for midfielder Harvey Elliott, who became the youngest player ever to start a match in the competition for Liverpool at the age of 18 years and 318 days. The only negative on an otherwise upbeat night for the Reds was an injury to Portugal forward Diogo Jota, who was replaced by goalscorer Firmino at the start of the second half after suffering an ankle injury. Liverpool have now won seven successive matches in all competitions, with this arguably the most impressive of the current run. But Klopp's team had to dig deep as Inter looked the more threatening side after a strong start by the Premier League club. Former Manchester City forward Edin Dzeko found himself clean through in the first half before a vital challenge by Virgil van Dijk, who was captaining the Reds in the absence of Jordan Henderson. The hosts went close again when Ivan Perisic whipped in a cross, but Lautaro Martinez was unable to give Inter the lead. In a fascinating match, Liverpool took the lead through Firmino's glancing 75th-minute header before Salah doubled the lead eight minutes later. There is still work to do for Klopp's team but it is going to require something extra special from Inter to turn this tie around. Liverpool remain in the hunt for four trophies and could have one in the bag by the time Inter visit Merseyside, with the Reds facing Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on 27 February. Despite it only being half full because of Covid-19 restrictions, there was an incredible atmosphere inside the San Siro for the first meeting between these two clubs for 14 years. Elliott, who does not turn 19 until April, embraced the occasion on what was his first start since suffering a serious ankle injury in September. The teenager did not look out of place on one of the most famous stages in world football and produced a cross in the first half which was just cut out before Salah could poke it over the line. Elliott was replaced in the 59th minute as part of a triple change as Klopp attempted to turn the tide as Inter threatened - a move that worked as Liverpool went on to establish a strong advantage. \"He did the job, he was working incredibly hard, but when you're 18 years old and playing one of the most experienced teams in world football, it is not a walk in the park,\" said Klopp.  \"So it was an important game for him and very helpful for us as well.\" Andrew Robertson Formation    3-5-2 Formation    4-3-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60393296"},
{"title": "Bayern Munich 7-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg (8-2 agg): Hosts thrash Austrians to advance into last eight", "content": "Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick inside the opening 23 minutes as Bayern Munich thrashed Red Bull Salzburg to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. The Poland captain, on his 100th start in the competition, confidently stroked home two penalties inside 21 minutes, after twice being recklessly brought down by Salzburg defender Maximilian Wober, the second confirmed after a VAR review. The first spot-kick, swept into the bottom-left corner, was Lewandowski's 40th goal of the season in all competitions. He added his third after chasing down an attempted clearance from visiting goalkeeper Philipp Kohn to tap in from close range.  It is the first time a Champions League hat-trick has been completed as early as the 23rd minute, although it is not the quickest treble in the competition, with that record held by Bafetimbi Gomis following his three goals in eight minutes for Lyon in a 7-1 win over Dinamo Zagreb in 2011. Bayern's quick start put them firmly in control of a game that had been billed as \"all or nothing\" by some in the Bavarian media after the six-time winners were held to a  disappointing 1-1 draw in the first leg in Austria. Matthias Jaissle's Salzburg had early chances with Nicolas Capaldo and Nicolas Seiwald both guilty of failing to convert glorious opportunities.  They were made to pay for their profligacy by the deadly Lewandowski before another mistake in defence allowed Serge Gnabry to add a fourth with a low shot that squirmed under Kohn, while Thomas Muller thumped in a fifth after the break.  On an otherwise bleak night for the visitors Maurits Kjaergaard did at least mange a consolation with a powerful effort into the top-left corner.  But that only seemed to stir Julian Nagelsmann's team back into life, with Muller finishing off a well-worked move for number six before Leroy Sane thumped home late on. Much had been made of Bayern's defensive vulnerabilities after they only scraped a late draw in the first leg, and Salzburg appeared to have real hope of becoming the first Austrian team to reach the last eight of this competition since 1985. But when it came to it they simply had no answer to a masterclass at the Allianz Arena, with Lewandowski the catalyst for a simple yet ruthless night's work by the hosts.  The 33-year-old twice outfoxed Wober to set the tone for the second leg and his third - as he reached 85 Champions League goals in three fewer matches than Lionel Messi and 17 before Cristiano Ronaldo - was all about his determination to keep going.  After Ronaldo (seven) and Messi (five), Lewandowski is now only the third player to score 10 or more goals in three or more different Champions League campaigns. And not content to rest on his laurels after becoming the top scorer in this season's competition, Lewandowski was also involved in Muller's second before teeing up Sane for Bayern's seventh of the night.

Barca have not been absent from the last 16 since 2003-04, when they did not qualify for the competition at all. This exit continues a miserable campaign for the Spanish giants after financial issues forced them to let club legend Lionel Messi leave on a free transfer and then join Paris St-Germain in the summer. Barca needed to match Benfica's result to advance, but the Portuguese side won 2-0 at home to Dynamo Kyiv, leaving Xavi's men third and facing a Europa League knockout round play-off. The game, played in snowy conditions and without fans because of a rise in Covid-19 cases in Germany, had got away from the visitors by half-time. Bayern scored their first when Robert Lewandowski's cross found Thomas Muller and his header just crossed the line, before they doubled their lead thanks to a superb 30-yard strike from former Manchester City forward Leroy Sane. Jamal Musiala added a third goal in the second half with a routine finish after a pull-back from Alphonso Davies. Barcelona had chances to take the lead when it was goalless but Jordi Alba, who later went off with a hamstring injury, had a shot saved by Manuel Neuer and Ousmane Dembele also wasted a chance by firing over.

{"title": "Man Utd 1-1 Young Boys: Youthful United side held in final Champions League group game", "content": "1099 Mason Greenwood's spectacular ninth-minute opener failed to inspire Manchester United's second string who were held to a disappointing Champions League draw by Swiss side Young Boys. With qualification as group winners having been secured with a game to spare, interim boss Ralf Rangnick gave all 11 players who started the Premier League win over Crystal Palace a night off. But, other than Greenwood, who brilliantly volleyed Luke Shaw's cross into the corner, it was not a night when United's fringe players made much of an impression. A rare opportunity for Donny van de Beek only resulted in the Dutchman providing 19-year-old Fabian Rieder with the chance to equalise for David Wagner's men and Quentin Maceiras should have won it for the visitors but fired wide from an excellent position after finding himself unmarked in the box. Rangnick introduced Robbie Savage's son, Charlie, for a first-team debut - something his dad never managed during his time as an Old Trafford junior - two minutes from time.  At the same time, Zidane Iqbal became the first British-born player of Asian heritage to make a senior appearance for the club. The night did not end well for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who had to be taken of on a stretcher after the final whistle. A place in Monday's draw is something of an achievement for United, who have only reached the knockout round five times since the 2011 final, when they were beaten by Barcelona, and on only four occasions since Sir Alex Ferguson retired two years later. On this evidence, few will give them much hope of winning the competition for a fourth time, although there are a lot of big names for Rangnick to call upon when the action starts again next February. Greenwood's latest goal means he has now scored eight in European competition - excluding qualifiers - for United, a record for any player for the club before their 21st birthday, overtaking Marcus Rashford. Rangnick will want more from the youngster given the manager's preference to press high up the pitch, something which will only give his chances of breaking back into Gareth Southgate's England squad a lift. Of all the players given a starting spot by Rangnick, goalkeeper Dean Henderson had the most pressing need to impress. Overlooked this season by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after missing the start of the campaign, Henderson is desperate to play regularly to try to regain his England spot, and if January comes and he still finds himself on the bench, he is likely to seek a loan move. A couple of dashes out of his box to make clearances and a decent save to deny Christopher Martins' effort represented a decent opening period until Rieder struck. In fairness to Henderson, the fault was not his as skipper Nemanja Matic played a pass to Van de Beek in a dangerous position which the Dutchman, given a rousing reception by the home fans who feel he should be given more opportunities, failed to control. Henderson was left exposed too often after half-time as United's second string found it an increasing struggle to keep their opponents at bay. Maceiras should have scored in what was the last bit of action around Henderson's goal before the keeper was replaced by Tom Heaton, who was making his United debut nearly two decades after he first joined the club.

A dramatic equaliser from substitute Magomed Ozdoev four minutes into added time meant holders Chelsea failed to top their group. Ozdoev scored a stunning half-volley from the edge of the box after Chelsea had come from behind to lead 3-2 with minutes left. Timo Werner scored in both halves and also set up Romelu Lukaku after Zenit had come from 1-0 down to lead 2-1. But Ozdoev's strike meant Chelsea finish behind Juventus,  who beat Malmo . \"We had a very good first 15 minutes and then we stopped doing the things we did in the first 15 minutes,\" said Tuchel. \"We were forgetting why we were the better team. Our behaviour changed when we had the lead and this is something we never did and we should never do. \"We do the things that we want to do on the highest level and we push ourselves and it hurts and it has to hurt. \"You have to play through pain - physical pain - and you have to raise your level of concentration and you have to overcome adversity. \"If you change your behaviour because of the score, you allow the possibility to get punished. It's as easy as the basics. The basics need to be pushed onto a higher level while we are in the lead.\" Tuchel's side - whose only defeat during the group stages came in Turin when they  lost 1-0 to Juventus  - made the perfect start, Werner reacting to poke in the opener within three minutes. Two goals in quick succession from Claudinho and Sardar Azmoun saw Zenit go in front at the break, before Werner's one-two with Ross Barkley helped tee up Lukaku for Chelsea's second.  Werner, who was a threat for Chelsea throughout, showed composure to make it 3-2 when substitute Christian Pulisic played him in with five minutes remaining. But Ozdoev's stunning stoppage-time strike ensured Juventus topped Group H, while Zenit finished in third and will go into the Europa League play-offs in February. Tuchel made eight changes for the game in Russia, saying fresh legs were needed to manage a heavy fixture schedule in December.  Lukaku, returning to the side for the first time since October after injury, lacked sharpness but was in the right place to tap in Werner's cut-back in the second half.  Werner thought he had given Chelsea victory when he slotted in his second late on - anxiously awaiting a check from the video assistant referee for a potential offside. But Zenit, who had threatened Chelsea on numerous occasions in the first half, remained a threat deep into stoppage time. Earlier misses from Mason Mount, Werner and Saul will add to Chelsea's disappointment but Zenit also had chances of their own - Azmoun was denied in a one-on-one with Kepa Arrizabalaga in the first half and again from a header in the second.

With Ralf Rangnick's side already through to the knock-out stages of the Champions League, the manager used several young first-team debutants against Swiss side Young Boys at Old Trafford in a  1-1 draw . Robbie Savage's son Charlie, 18, was one of those players and made some of the headlines, but the impact of Iqbal, also 18, was a major landmark - with plenty of reaction from fans on social media to his 89th minute appearance. Midfielder Iqbal is a local Manchester lad from Whalley Range, born to a Pakistani father and Iraqi mother. After being with United since he was young, he signed his first professional contract in April. Recent figures  suggest that  - despite making up about 7% of the British population, only 0.25% of professional footballers are from any British Asian background. In terms of the British South Asian population, this is the first time that a footballer of that heritage has played for an English club in the Champions League since Michael Chopra played for Newcastle United during the 2002-03 season. Iqbal told MUTV: \"It feels amazing, I've been working my whole life for this opportunity. It's a dream come true, it's just the start and hopefully I can keep pushing on. \"It was crazy, I was waiting for the ball to go out, embracing it all, looking at the fans. When I came on the loud cheer from the fans was unreal. \"It was more excitement. Last night I just about slept. I was just embracing it all really. I was hoping to get a touch. I did thankfully. I really enjoyed it.\" Iqbal represented United's U18s and U23s prior to his senior debut. He wears the number 73 shirt. He could be eligible to play for England, Iraq or Pakistan. Earlier this year the teenager represented the Iraq U23 side in international friendlies. BBC Sport's Simon Stone says Iqbal is also a talented Futsal player who has been coached by his FA level two qualified dad Aamar. His younger brother Daoud is also a talented footballer. Iqbal is also part of the PFA Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme and attended two events during the summer to connect with peers - as well as giving up his evenings on a number of occasions this year to share his experiences with younger peers via zoom, which has been described as \"inspiring\" for some of those families. Iqbal recently spoke to BBC Sport about his future prospects. On his namesake Zinedine Zidane, the legendary former France and Real Madrid midfielder, Iqbal said: \"To be honest, when I was younger I didn't really think anything of it.  \"But, as I got older, I found out there was a great, great player called Zinedine Zidane.\" \"It's good knowing I might be a role model. I'd want to be a good one.\" There was a lot of positive reaction to his inclusion in the side on social media. One Manchester United fan said: \"To my young British Asian brothers and sisters, it can happen.\" Another said: \"If I was six, seven, eight years old right now, I'm looking at my TV, going 'oh my God, this guy looks like me, he's from my end and he's playing for Manchester United,' it's huge.\" Amongst all the celebrations, one man who was very proud was dad Aamar.

Araujo was one of four players who usually play in central defence who played the final hour in Barca's back four. \"Ultimately, we didn't not qualify because of this game but because of what we did in the other games,\" he continued. What happened in the other games was two more 3-0 defeats and precisely two goals - both against rock bottom Dynamo Kyiv. \"It's true that, right now, we're not among the best teams in Europe,\" said Araujo. \"If we were, we'd have qualified. Our objective now is to win the Europa League. We have to go out to compete and try to win it.\" Barcelona's squad is a combination of ageing legends, players who would not have got near the great Barca teams and talented youngsters. They famously lost their all-time top scorer Lionel Messi and several other first-team players in the summer as part of a financial crisis they are still in the middle of. Former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole said on BT Sport: \"I wouldn't say there are three players - outside the young players - they'd want to keep hold of. They simply can't compete in the Champions League with that group of players.\" This was their seventh defeat of the season in all competitions. They are 16 points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid after 15 games. Spanish football journalist Pete Jenson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't think people believed in the miracle that was needed tonight. \"There's such a gap now between the best teams in Europe and Barcelona. They're in a different league now in the Europa League and I don't think too many of their supporters think they can even win that. \"They've got some serious issues looming - sponsorship deals are running out and they've got financial implications to deal with too. \"They won't talk about it but they were heavily failing two or three seasons ago; it was Messi that was keeping them afloat and in the competitions.\" Spanish newspaper website Marca  led with the headline 'Europa League embarrassment'. \"Barca is still trapped in time. The nightmare began after 2-8 in Lisbon [Bayern's 2020 quarter-final win over Barca] and continues to this day after falling in Munich and being relegated to the Europa League.\" Barcelona have excellent youngsters scattered throughout their team - but they need to add to their quality if they are to reach the elite again. Gavi, 17, Ansu Fati and Pedri, both 19, are all senior Spain internationals. Pedri was named the best young player of 2021 in France Football's recent Ballon d'Or ceremony. There have been some promising signs in terms of performance since they hired former captain Xavi, 41, from Qatari side Al Sadd after sacking Koeman. Spanish football journalist Jenson said: \"Even after five games it's clear to see that Xavi has got aspects of Pep Guardiola in him.  \"He's got the charisma and a clear vision. But ultimately if you haven't got the players then you can't put that into action.\" Ex-Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said on BT Sport: \"They've got the right man in charge. He knows the club inside out and knows how the youth academy works.  \"Their future is youth because they don't have money to buy players like they have. They have to build from young players up.  \"They have some good ones but it's not going to be a quick process - it could be five years.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59588813"},

He added: \"The performances are not horrible or bad.

However, the German, who led the club to Champions League success in May, is unconcerned by what he considers a minor blip and is relishing the opportunity to put things right. \"We've learned now, hopefully, twice from experience, and we have the chance to prove it now tomorrow,\" Tuchel added.  \"It is back to basics - and basics on the highest level. We are in this together.  \"From my experience, I can say I always find it very challenging to keep things on track even when the results are good.

Kerr also had a second-half effort ruled out for offside as Juve held on. The result maintains Juve's own hopes of advancing. The point at Kingsmeadow against the Italian champions came just three days after Emma Hayes' side beat Arsenal in the the delayed 2020-21 Women's FA Cup final at Wembley. \"This was the tough one for me, being so close after the cup final,\" said Hayes.  \"I know they celebrated like it was their cup final.

Juve remain second in the group, level on points with Wolfsburg, and next face winless Swiss champions Servette. The visitors swamped Peyraud-Magnin to celebrate the draw after the French goalkeeper made a series of saves to help earn the point. She did enough early on to foil Cuthbert with the help of the woodwork, and produced the moment of the match to keep Millie Bright out with a diving save before the break. Kerr almost beat the inspired keeper with a wayward cross that drifted on to the bar in the first half, but it was a frustrating night for the Australian and the her team-mates after they had 71% possession and racked up 25 shots to Juventus' two.

Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United won their respective groups, while Chelsea went through as runners-up. The three English teams who topped the group are among the eight seeded clubs, along with Ajax, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Lille. Chelsea join Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Sporting Lisbon, Inter Milan, Benfica, Salzburg and Villarreal as the non-seeded sides in the draw. The draw for the Europa League knockout round play-off also takes place on Monday. Here is everything you need to know about both draws.  The draw is taking place at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, with the 'ceremony' scheduled to start at 11:00 GMT. Uefa's website is live streaming the draw, while the BBC Sport website will have text commentary and reaction. The live stream on Uefa's website will appear on  this link. The 16 teams will be put into two pots - one for the seeded teams, who are the eight group winners, and one for the unseeded teams, who are the eight runners up. Teams from the same national association cannot be drawn against each other at this stage.  That means the four Premier League clubs cannot meet, while teams cannot face opponents they faced during the group stage, either. For example, Group A winners Manchester City will not be drawn against Paris St-Germain, who were runners-up in the same pool.  Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United are all seeded along with German giants Bayern Munich and record 13-time winners Real Madrid. The eight unseeded teams, who all finished runners-up in their respective groups, are Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, PSG, Sporting Lisbon, Chelsea, Red Bull Salzburg, Villarreal and Benfica. Manchester United and PSG could potentially meet in the last 16, which would put Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - widely regarded as two greatest players of their generation - on a collision course.

Seeded teams will be away for the first leg before being at home for the return matches. All kick-offs are at 20:00 GMT. The draw for the quarter-finals is on 18 March. The away goals rule has been removed, so ties level after 180 minutes will go to extra time.  If the teams still cannot be separated after the additional 30 minutes then it goes to a penalty shoot-out. St Petersburg, Russia, will stage the 2022 Champions League final, with the game scheduled for 28 May 2022. The draw for the Europa League knockout round play-off features 16 teams.  They include the eight runners-up from the Europa League group stage - who will be seeded - while the eight third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage will be unseeded. Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla are among those dropping down from the Champions League. The other five teams dropping down are RB Leipzig, Porto, Sheriff Tiraspol, Atalanta and Zenit St Petersburg. The eight Europa League runners-up are Rangers, Real Sociedad, Napoli, Olympiakos, Lazio, Sporting Braga, Real Betis and Dinamo Zagreb. West Ham United , who  lost 1-0 at home to Dinamo Zagreb  on Thursday, will not feature in this draw as they have won their group.

Arnaut Danjuma gave the visitors a third-minute lead in a match postponed on Wednesday by heavy snow. Etienne Capoue added a second before half-time and Danjuma made it 3-0 six minutes after the restart. Ruslan Malinovskyi and Duvan Zapata responded for Atalanta, who were unable to earn the victory they required.

They made the perfect start when Danjuma raced on to Dani Parejo's pass and slotted through the legs of Juan Musso with the first chance of the match. With only three points enough for Atalanta, things got even worse for the Serie A side as Capoue beat Musso at his near post and Danjuma scored again with a smart turn and finish to leave the Italians requiring four goals in 39 minutes.

A \"technical problem\" caused an error in the initial draw, which Uefa said had been \"declared void\". Premier League champions Manchester City face Portugal's Sporting Lisbon while six-time winners Liverpool play three-time winners Inter Milan. Manchester United face Spanish champions Atletico Madrid. In the standout tie of the round, 13-time champions Real Madrid come up against French powerhouse Paris St-Germain. In the original draw, Manchester United's ball was pulled out of the pot against Villarreal but they were ineligible to face each other as they had been in the same group - an eventuality Uefa said the technology should have prevented. Last season's Europa League winners Villarreal were instead paired with Premier League champions City. Further confusion appeared to occur when United were excluded from the pot of possible opponents for Atletico Madrid, and Liverpool included instead. However, United could have played the Spanish side and Liverpool could not, having progressed into the knockout stage from the same group. Uefa said in a statement: \"Following a technical problem with the software of an external service provider that instructs the officials as to which teams are eligible to play each other, a material error occurred in the draw for the Uefa Champions League round of 16. \"As a result of this, the draw has been declared void and will be entirely redone.\" The first legs will be spread out across 15, 16, 22 and 23 February, with the second legs on 8, 9, 15 and 16 March. Chelsea are the only English side to play their first leg at home, with the other three all away first after winning their groups. A major change from this season sees the away goals rule removed, so ties level after 180 minutes will go to extra time. If the teams still cannot be separated after the additional 30 minutes, then it goes to a penalty shootout. This season's final takes place in St Petersburg, Russia, on 28 May. The high farce of the twice-run Champions League last-16 draw was yet another example of sport's ability to make something seemingly simply so complicated - but at least the Premier League's quartet of clubs finally know their fate.  For Chelsea, it was the same second time around after a \"software\" glitch was resolved as they were paired once more with French champions Lille, a draw that will leave them cautiously optimistic of progress.  Manchester United, having originally been lined up for the next chapter in the rivalry between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi after drawing Paris St-Germain, still got a tough one in Atletico Madrid in the revised version. Tough, but maybe not quite as tough as it once was with Atletico struggling for form. No-one, however, should write off coach Diego Simeone's ability to make life hard for anyone in this tournament.  Liverpool fared slightly worse at the second time of asking. Italian champions and Serie A leaders Inter Milan will present a tougher challenge than original opponents Red Bull Salzburg but Jurgen Klopp's side will still be favourites.  Manchester City will also believe they can find their way into the last eight as they will now meet Sporting Lisbon of Portugal after the redraw. They would also been favourites from their first pairing against Villarreal and each of the Premier League sides will firmly believe they can reach the last eight. The redraw meant spectators were robbed of a meeting between PSG and Manchester United which would have pitted two of the greatest players of all time against each other in Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

{"title": "AC Milan v Red Star Belgrade: Arrigo Sacchi's 'Immortals' & their brush with death", "content": "For a team that would enter football history as The Immortals, it was a chilling reminder of the frailty of human life.  On 10 November 1988, Arrigo Sacchi's AC Milan faced Red Star Belgrade at their Marakana Stadium in the European Cup second round, second leg. The match - replayed from the previous day after an abandonment due to fog - took a horrifying turn just before half-time. The score was 1-1 - and 2-2 on aggregate - when Red Star defender Goran Vasilijevic clashed with Milan's Roberto Donadoni. Sacchi, in his newly published memoir The Immortals, describes the incident.  \"Vasilijevic went in violently on Donadoni, hitting him with a head butt and an elbow at the same time,\" writes the Italian coach. \"Roberto hit the deck, knocked out. These were moments of true terror: he looked dead. Players were waving their arms about and putting their hands on their heads.\" As Donadoni lay prone, Angelo Pagani, the Milan masseur, was first to reach him. He managed to open the player's mouth - jammed shut due to a fractured jaw - and free his tongue, which had been forced to the back of his mouth and threatened to choke him.  Milan doctor Ginko Monti, next on the scene, administered mouth-to-mouth. \"Roberto showed no sign of life, and then he began to stamp his feet on the ground, which often happens to people who have suffered cranial trauma,\" writes Sacchi. Donadoni's team-mates looked on in horror. Legendary Milan and Italy defender Paolo Maldini recalled the fateful moment: \"He was blue, with his eyes wide open, and he was stamping his feet like an animal in the slaughterhouse.\"  Marco van Basten, the team's iconic Dutch striker, ran to the Milan bench shouting \"A doctor! A doctor!\" before seeking comfort in the arms of general manager Paolo Taveggia and bursting into tears. Van Basten did not want to play on but the Milan coaching team convinced him to, as Donadoni was carried off on a stretcher and rushed to hospital. A shell-shocked Milan returned to the dressing room at half-time. Then they heard an announcement over the public address system which was roundly booed by the home crowd. When the same announcement was made in Italian, they understood.  Sacchi explains: \"The announcer had wanted to reassure fans who had seen Donadoni lying on the turf for so long without moving, by telling them the good news coming from the hospital. Roberto had regained consciousness and, apart from that fractured jaw, no serious damage appeared to have been done. The Red Star fans were booing his good health.\" Milan's players, including Ruud Gullit, were furious. Gullit had replaced his stricken team-mate and was struggling so badly with a left thigh injury that he was only due to play 45 minutes. In the end, he played all the second half plus extra time and penalties. Sacchi describes the Dutchman as \"our courage, our general in battle\". A battle it was. With hostility pouring from the stands, Milan kept attacking. Their captain Franco Baresi transmitted calm and belief as they searched for a winner. \"Every time he came out with the ball at his feet, the flames of hell made way,\" writes Sacchi. But an exhausted Milan could not score again and, with an aggregate score of 2-2, the tie went to penalties.  Stojkovic converted Red Star's first and Baresi replied for Milan. Robert Prosinecki scored the home side's second. Then Van Basten stepped up.  Sacchi: \"Van Basten moved towards the ball with that swan-like elegance. He barely touched it but it flew - hard and unsaveable - into the top-right corner. Perfect execution. I had the sense that the whole Marakana had been frozen by this exhibition of confidence and technique.\" That conversion was perhaps the decisive moment of the shootout. Dejan Savicevic followed up for the home side with a limp effort that was saved by the legs of goalkeeper Giovanni Galli before Chicco Evani made it 3-2 to Milan. When Mitar Mrkela then missed for Red Star, Frank Rijkaard stepped forward with the chance to put the Italian side into the quarter-finals of the European Cup. Sacchi turned his back, unable to watch.  \"Through the absolute silence of the Marakana, I heard the dull thud of the ball striking a post,\" he recalls. \"The blood froze in my veins. But after hitting the woodwork, the ball rolled into the net. I've never forgotten the sound of that post - a hymn to happiness.  \"I ran on to the pitch and hugged each of my players in turn. We had beaten Red Star, but also suffered injustice, violence, provocation. They'd spat in our faces, a policeman had set his wolfhound on Alessandro Costacurta. And yet we'd been stronger than everything and everyone.\"  However, the Milan players' joy was tempered by their team-mate's brush with death. In a later interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, Donadoni recalled the scene at the hospital.  \"The first clear image I have is waking up in the room of the hospital,\" he said. \"With me there were two gentlemen: one was terminally ill and kept asking me how I was, the other had fallen three storeys. He didn't have a bone in place, but he peeled mandarins and squeezed the juice over my lips because I couldn't open my mouth. They were in a much more serious condition but were worried about me as if I were the most in need: what a wonderful way to explain how lucky I had been. \"The thing that struck me most in reviewing the images of the incident was the reaction of my companions, who were visibly frightened and worried. They immediately realised the gravity of the moment. From these things you can see the great sense of belonging and friendship that binds you to your team-mates.\" Some of the bitterness Milan felt over their treatment in Belgrade was assuaged when both Red Star manager Branko Stankovic and Vasilijevic visited Donadoni in hospital. Milan's flamboyant chairman Silvio Berlusconi gifted the player an expensive painting after his ordeal, but it is Sacchi who paints the most vivid portrait.  \"Roberto always gave the absolute maximum in every minute of the match or training session,\" he writes. \"He gave the best possible interpretation of my concept of hard work and sense of duty. For this reason, his team-mates called him 'Bone'. He never gave in.  \"He was a hero. Not because he ended up in hospital. He was a hero in the manner defined by Romain Rolland - the French writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915. 'A hero is someone who does what he can.'  \"I agree with this sentiment, and using it, I can say that I coached a team of heroes who then became Immortal.\" After beating Red Star, Sacchi's team never looked back. They scored 11 goals and conceded just once against their following three European opponents that season. Werder Bremen were beaten in the quarters and Real Madrid in the semi-finals before a 4-0 thrashing of Steaua Bucharest in the final. And they repeated their European Cup title triumph the following year, a 1-0 victory over Benfica in 1990 enshrining their legend.  As that one night in Belgrade proved, however, Milan's 'Immortals' tag spoke as much to their bravery in extreme adversity as it did to the beauty of their football.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59307802"},
{"title": "Champions League: Liverpool 2-0 Porto - Thiago and Mohamed Salah score", "content": "654 Liverpool maintained their 100% record in the Champions League this season by seeing off Porto at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's men, who had already secured top spot in Group B and a place in the knockout stages after winning their first four games, picked up another three points against the Portuguese side. The Reds were not at their best in the first half and although hardly at full tilt in the second either, they scored two lovely goals to clinch another victory. Spain midfielder Thiago drilled in a stunning, long-range finish, cutting across the ball to produce a rasping 25-yard strike that nestled in the bottom corner. Egypt forward Mohamed Salah then cut in from the right and jinked his way past a visiting defender before smashing home at the near post. Porto were punished for missing a glorious chance after 11 minutes when Otavio inexplicably side-footed wide from eight yards out with an empty goal to aim at. Liverpool hammered Porto 5-1 in the reverse fixture in Portugal and could have handed out another similarly emphatic victory but Sadio Mane's cool finish was ruled out by VAR for offside, as was Takumi Minamino's volley from close range. Klopp said: \"Whoever sees Thiago in training knows he has the technique to do it but even with this technique it doesn't happen constantly that he can fire such a thunderball. \"We could have done better and been more calm in the first half but we were a bit hectic. That is not unusual when you put a team out that has not played together a lot. \"Some people think we might play an easy game but we were not here for that, Anfield is sold out so we want to go (for it).\" The good news for Porto was that AC Milan secured a late victory at Atletico Madrid, meaning the Portuguese side stay second in the group. Victory for Sergio Conceicao's side in the final group game against the La Liga champions will guarantee passage into the knockout stages. Klopp rested defender Virgil van Dijk, right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and midfielder Fabinho while also resisting the temptation to start full-back Andrew Robertson and skipper Jordan Henderson, both of whom are returning to full fitness after injuries. However the 2019 European champions still had too much class for Porto. Thiago has endured a stop-start time since joining the club at the start of last season as he adjusted to English football and struggled to gain any rhythm as he dealt with regular injuries. But the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich player showed his quality at times last season and is doing so more regularly in this campaign, backing up Saturday's excellent performance against Arsenal with another fine showing on Wednesday. He played just over an hour and recycled the ball in trademark fashion - but the highlight of the night was his goal in front of The Kop. There looked to be no danger when Porto cleared a corner out of the area, but Thiago showed sublime technique to score his first goal of the season. The prolific Salah was quiet for much of the contest but converted the one chance that fell his way to take his tally to 17 goals in as many games this term. His strike meant Liverpool have scored two or more goals in 16 consecutive games in all competitions, the first English team to achieve that feat since Wolves in 1939. Mane saw a shot deflected away from goal and scuffed off target from a promising position, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - enjoying an extended run in the side - screwed wide from the edge of the box. Academy product Tyler Morton, 19, filled in for Brazil's Fabinho and played the full 90 minutes on his first Champions League start in the middle of the park. Klopp added: \"If you are in our squad, you are good football player. I have been in the business long enough not to throw players in who are not ready. \"Neco Williams can play, people might be surprised with Tyler Morton but he did exceptionally well. He is a good player and really pleased for him that he put a performance in like this.\" Porto will be glad to see the back of Liverpool having failed to beat the Reds in their past 10 meetings and extending their poor record in England to just one win in their past 23 games. Had winger Otavio taken the early chance that fell his way, it could have been a different story but their big game is now against the Spanish champions.

Youngs Boys will stay in a \"strictly separated bubble\" for the duration of their time in England. Youngs Boys said they \"would like to thank the Canton of Bern for the flexibility and the exemption and will do everything in its power to continue to act as a role model\". United have already qualified as Group F winners but Young Boys could still secure a place in the Europa League if they repeat their  victory over the Premier League side  in September.

Markus Soder, the Minister-President of Bavaria, which includes Munich, has said he plans to prevent fans from attending sports events in the German state because of a rise in coronavirus infections - although he did not give a timetable for bringing in such measures. \"Football matches should be without spectators again.

Concerns around the new Omicron variant mean anyone entering Switzerland from the UK has to isolate for 10 days. Governing body Uefa is seeking clarification over whether that would apply to the Young Boys party. If so, then Uefa rules state a neutral venue should be found, though the game could be moved to a different date. United have already qualified as Group F winners but Young Boys could still secure a place in the Europa League if they emulate their  victory over the Premier League side  in September. If the game was moved, it would cost United millions of pounds in lost gate receipts. Switzerland is among a number of European countries to reimpose coronavirus restrictions amid a  surge in cases  across the continent, with sporting events also impacted. West Ham's Europa League tie  against Rapid Vienna  in Austria last week was played behind closed doors as part of a new national lockdown, while all matches in the Netherlands are being played without fans after a partial lockdown was introduced earlier in November. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich's game at home to Barcelona in the Champions League on 8 December could be played behind closed doors. Markus Soder, the Minister-President of Bavaria, which includes Munich, has said he plans to prevent fans from attending sports events in the German state because of a rise in coronavirus infections - although he did not give a timetable for bringing in such measures. \"Football matches should be without spectators again.

{"title": "Philippe Coutinho: How did Barcelona's record signing become a bit-part misfit?", "content": "767 When Barcelona travel to Bayern Munich on Wednesday, it's unclear whether their record signing will take part. It's a must-win game for Xavi's team. Otherwise, a home victory for Benfica over already eliminated Dynamo Kyiv would see Barca fail to reach the Champions League knockout stage for the first time since 2004. Former Liverpool superstar Philippe Coutinho, however, is far from certain to play against his former club, having made a gradual slide from the third-most expensive player in history to a largely overlooked afterthought. What on earth has happened? The catalyst for  Coutinho's arrival in Barcelona  in January 2018 was a pair of key departures - Neymar's shock move to Paris St-Germain in August 2017 and the knowledge that club icon Andres Iniesta was soon heading through the exit door. Loaded with £200m from the enforced sale of Neymar and therefore in a weak bargaining position, Barca never hid the fact Coutinho was their number one target to become the 'new Iniesta' and the 'new Neymar' rolled into one. Liverpool resisted but eventually negotiated an initial £106m fee, allowing Coutinho to complete his \"dream\" move to the Catalan coast. But the dream soon became a nightmare. It was quickly apparent - as it probably always should have been - that Coutinho was not suited to either of his expected new roles. He wanted to play further forward than Iniesta's disciplined midfield role and more centrally than Neymar's left-wing slot. Instead, he preferred to roam more central areas and find space between the lines of the opposition midfield and defence. But Barca already had someone fulfilling that role and there was no way Coutinho would ever usurp Lionel Messi as the team's main creator. So Coutinho ended up generally getting in Messi's way, disrupting the team's rhythm by taking too many touches and reduced to hopeful long-range strikes with sporadic success - leading social media wits to sarcastically dub him 'Shootinho'. The arrival of Antoine Griezmann in July 2019 further hindered Coutinho's hopes of becoming a key player and he was pushed out to Bayern Munich on a season-long loan that Barca hoped would lead to a permanent sale. But Coutinho was no more than a bit-part player in Germany too, starting less than half of Bayern's games. The highlight of his spell came in the Champions League against none other than his parent club Barca, scoring twice off the bench in the era-defining 8-2 quarter-final pummelling. Bayern rejected the chance to sign Coutinho permanently, preferring to spend their Covid-19 reduced budget on Leroy Sane from Manchester City, so the Brazilian was sent back to Barcelona in the summer of 2020. He found the club in a state of disarray. Messi was in open warfare with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who would soon be forced to resign, Luis Suarez led a line of established veterans who had been forced out, and new manager Ronald Koeman was struggling to impose his authority. Nevertheless, Coutinho made a promising start to the 2020-21 season and found favour with Koeman, becoming a regular in the starting line-up before his latest setback came in the form of a knee injury that sidelined him for eight months, scuppering financially desperate Barca's flagging hopes of selling him last summer. The outcome was another wasted season. When Coutinho returned in September, Koeman was in his last days in charge as the team stumbled from one crisis to another. Coutinho soon sparked controversy by  warming up with miserable reluctance  during interim boss Sergi Barjuan's final game at Celta Vigo. But if the 29-year-old thought Xavi's arrival would herald a fresh opportunity, those hopes were soon dashed. Coutinho was a late substitute in the new boss' first game - a 1-0 home win over Espanyol. But he was then left on the bench for the Champions League draw with Benfica despite the vital nature of the tie, Xavi preferring teenagers Yusuf Demir, Nico Gonzalez and Gavi to the club's record signing. He did score a late penalty off the bench against Villarreal, but Saturday's home loss against Real Betis was another disappointment. Coutinho got his first start under Xavi and made a decent early impression before fading badly and being replaced before the hour mark. Football analyst Domagoj Kostanjsak explained why Coutinho looks unlikely to enjoy a revival under Xavi, even now Messi has gone.  He told BBC Sport: \"With Xavi, width and verticality are more relevant than in the past. Xavi loves aggressive midfielders who make runs beyond the opposition's line and attack space with pace and power. Coutinho can't do that.  \"We're never going to see Coutinho's full potential at Barca unless the system is catered towards him, which is unlikely to say the least. He doesn't fit the winger or the midfielder roles - and the number 10 role he loves doesn't exist in such a way to accommodate his skill set.\" Indeed, Barca's greatest hope for Coutinho now is selling him - ideally to a cash-rich ambitious club like Newcastle - to reduce the club's debt and possibly even fund new signings such as Manchester City's Ferran Torres, who is a main target for Xavi. In the immediate future, though, Wednesday's decisive date with Bayern - like much of the past four years - is another game that could well pass Coutinho by.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59553010"},
{"title": "Liverpool v Atletico Madrid: How Luis Suarez became one of Europe's best strikers", "content": "Luis Suarez is considered by many Liverpool fans to be the club's best striker of the Premier League era, but on Wednesday night he returns to Anfield seeking to fire Atletico Madrid to a notable victory in the Champions League. Of course, Mohamed Salah's increasing brilliance has staked a strong claim for that crown but, wherever he ranks in the list of Liverpool strikers, the Kop know an in-form Suarez still can inflict damage on any side. He is the Reds' fifth highest-scoring forward of the Premier League era with 69 goals in 110 games between 2011-14 and, at 34 years of age, he is showing no signs of slowing down with eight goals for Atletico already this season. No-one needs much reminding about the Uruguay striker's stellar career, having won six top-flight titles, a Champions League trophy and four Copa Del Reys during his time in Europe that has also taken in spells at Groningen, Ajax and Barcelona. He has also had his fair share of controversies, including  punching the ball off the line  to deny Ghana victory against Uruguay in the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals,  biting  three opponents in his career, and being given an eight-match ban for  racially abusing  Patrice Evra. Nominated again for the Ballon d'Or this year, BBC Sport takes a look at Suarez's humble beginnings in Uruguay and how a love story helped him become one of Europe's most-feared strikers of the past 15 years.  Born in Salto, Uruguay's second-most populous city where Manchester United's Edinson Cavani was also born just 21 days later, Suarez was brought up in a large family with little money - so much so that his mum Sandra once described how they could never afford a pair of football boots for him. At the age of seven, Suarez moved to Uruguay's capital Montevideo with his parents and six brothers and played youth football at Urreta before switching to Nacional aged 14. He impressed in the youth ranks before being given his first-team debut in May 2005 against Junior of Colombia in the Copa Libertadores - but things went far from smoothly for him. His first goal didn't come for four months and he missed so many chances his own fans used to jeer him. Nacional's then manager Martin Lasarte told BBC Sport: \"The character of Luis was very important for all those months without scoring. For Nacional, Suarez was the best youth player of the club, but he had to win a place in the first team due to Bruno Fornaroli and Martin Cauteruccio being the fans' favourites. \"I had a walk with him one day after training, told him that he was going to sit on the bench in the next match, and I remember Luis got so mad with me. He didn't understand that was the best for him, but instead of being depressed or furious, he did double training on his own. \"I remember another day Luis told me he was going to play for Barcelona in the future, and he would not surrender until he did it. You know Barcelona in those days was like an impossible dream, but the history is marked - he made it.\" Thanks in no small part to Lasarte's belief in him and Suarez's own mental strength, the striker persevered and he ended with 10 goals in 27 matches as Nacional won the Uruguayan title.  Suarez's former Uruguay and Nacional team-mate Sebastian Abreu, said: \"We used to joke to Lasarte 'when you play Suarez every match, we have to go home, please be kind with us'. The rest of the strikers, when Luis started being in the 11, had to be on the bench or play a few minutes in the rest of the tournament. \"He was like a young boy with a lion mentality. Luis has a such winner's mentality, that he trained to win in everything he played. One day he came and told me, 'I know you all are in front of me in the squad, but I will beat you all'. \"He used the tough situations as a motivation for success - nothing was impossible for him even in those days. He never showed off in training, he trained hard many times in secret without us knowing, and got himself prepared to be the best striker of all time in Uruguay.\" Mathias Cardacio, a friend of Suarez's who played in Nacional's youth and first team with him, remembers how they used to turn up for training an hour early. He said: \"When we were in Nacional youth, we trained at 6pm, but he looked for me at 5pm to arrive early at the training ground to take shots and penalties before anyone else arrived. That was Luis every step, he wanted to perfect his skills. He didn't want to lose at anything. \"I remember when we played Huracan for the Nacional youth team and we won 18-0 with 11 goals from Suarez. He couldn't slow down, he was an animal that always wanted more and more. \"In every competition he wanted to win, whether it was playing football or in cards. He had a competitive thread in his body from when he was a small child.\" Suarez's exploits in front of goal earned him a move to Dutch top-flight side Groningen in 2006, where his 10 goals in 29 league matches brought a debut for Uruguay and a £6.75m move to Ajax. The rest is history as, after 111 goals in 159 appearances for the Amsterdam club, he moved to Liverpool for £22.7m in 2011 before heading to Barcelona and then Atletico. Former Groningen team-mate and fellow Uruguayan Bruno Silva says Suarez's move to Europe was initially one born out of love, rather than a desire to enhance his professional career. His girlfriend from the age of 13, and now wife, Sofia moved to Barcelona for family reasons aged just 15 and - while maintaining a long-distance relationship - Suarez was determined to move closer to her. Silva said: \"His decision to come to Europe was always thinking of being near his wife, Sofia, who was in Barcelona. He was determined, playing like a person that has the hunger to get to the top level quickly.\" Diego Forlan, who claimed the 2010 World Cup Golden Boot, added: \"In the World Cup in 2010 and in Copa America 2011 where we won the championship, we saw an outstanding version of Suarez, in every training session he wanted to win, to be the best. \"He gets in a bad mood if he loses a simple training match. That is Suarez, the man that has a hunger to win inside. \"Every time Suarez fell with something though, he had Sofia to get himself up, he had that motivation to never disappoint his family. All the things that happened to Luis, from Evra, to being suspended for biting or even with his injuries, he had Sofia with him and that is his support in life.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59118019"},

Pep Guardiola opted to field a strong side, which included a first club start since 6 November for Kevin de Bruyne, despite last season's runners-up having sealed top spot in Group A with one game to spare. But the Premier League leaders finished the six-match group stage without a clean sheet after Hungary midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai and Portugal forward Andre Silva scored for Leipzig, who parted company with their manager over the weekend. City also finished with 10 men after Kyle Walker was shown a straight red card in the last 10 minutes for an unnecessary foul on Silva.  Szoboszlai had rounded keeper Zack Steffen to open the scoring before Silva, who had earlier been denied by City's second-choice keeper, doubled the lead with a neat finish. The visitors,  who put six past Leipzig  at Etihad Stadium in September, suffered a frustrating night at an empty Red Bull Arena with Phil Foden having a shot tipped on to the post before Riyad Mahrez reduced the deficit with a diving header. City, who will discover their last-16 opponents on Monday, end their group campaign with 12 points from six games - and no clean sheets. In addition, the late dismissal of Walker means the England defender faces a suspension when his side resume their European campaign in February. Just days after Guardiola had praised his team for a performance that  propelled them to the summit  in England, City produced a disjointed display in Germany. Surprisingly, with a busy December schedule ahead, Guardiola opted to field the likes of Ilkay Gundogan, Fernandinho and Foden, who was replaced at the start of the second half, for what was effectively a dead rubber. Nineteen-year-old forward Cole Palmer was sent on three minutes from the end of normal time but fellow teenagers Conrad Egan-Riley, Josh Wilson-Esbrand, Romeo Lavia and James McAtee were unused. At least De Bruyne got some vital minutes under his belt after recovering from Covid-19. He forced Peter Gulacsi, who left Liverpool in 2013 without playing a league game, into a fine save from a free-kick on the stroke of half-time.

Mats Rits beat goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with a slotted finish for the visitors, who created several good chances.

Early goals by Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane, both created by Trent Alexander-Arnold, put the Reds in full command and there was no way back for the Spanish side once Felipe was sent off before half-time. Jurgen Klopp's side should have dished out more punishment after the break but missed a flurry of chances and Jota had another strike ruled out for offside by the video assistant referee. Atletico thought they had pulled a goal back from a deflected shot by former Reds striker Luis Suarez, but that too was chalked off for offside by VAR and they never seriously threatened a comeback. As well as sending Liverpool through to the knockout stage with two games to spare, the win extends the Reds' unbeaten start to the season to 16 games. In total, they have not tasted defeat for 25 matches, dating back to 6 April when they lost to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of last season's Champions League. Recent meetings between these two sides have been somewhat spiky, reflected by the mood inside Anfield right from the start, and this game did not lack controversy either. With their fans providing a raucous backdrop, Liverpool took around 10 minutes to find their feet but then tore into Atletico and began creating chances. Alexander-Arnold put the first goal on a plate for Jota with a delicious whipped delivery and although it was unclear whether he meant a shot or a cross for his side's second, the end result was the same thanks to Mane's alertness at the near post. Those two goals proved enough to secure the points, with the game effectively ended as contest when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie decided that Felipe's swipe at Mane's heels was enough for a straight red card. The home crowd did not get the deluge of goals they wanted in the second half but they did get to boo Suarez's every touch until he was substituted soon after his goal was disallowed.

{"title": "Liverpool 2-0 Atletico Madrid: Why Trent Alexander-Arnold is a weapon England cannot afford to waste", "content": "If anyone needs convincing that Trent Alexander-Arnold should be England's first-choice right-back, his performance against Atletico Madrid is a good place to start. I am not one of those who needs reminding of how good Trent is, but he still produces moments like his cross for Liverpool's first goal  in their win on Wednesday  that just make you go 'wow'. That kind of quality is what makes him a very special player indeed - and for me he is the best of a very good bunch that England have in his position. It's a close call between him and Chelsea's Reece James but, as good as James is going forward, he just does not have the same absolutely top-class delivery that Trent does. That's what counts for me. Of course the way Liverpool play helps Alexander-Arnold flourish - he basically played as a right-sided midfielder in the first half on Wednesday, he was that high up the pitch. But people who say he could play in central midfield for England are missing the point. It's a completely different role to the one he is so effective at for his club when he links up with Mohamed Salah down the right. With Liverpool, he is always coming on to the ball from a deeper position. It was the same for both the goals he made against Atletico - from there, he sees the big picture all the time. If he is in midfield instead, then he is playing on the half-turn a lot of the time when he collects the ball and it's harder to have the same idea of what's happening in front of him. I don't think that using him as a midfielder is an experiment worth repeating by Gareth Southgate, who announces his next squad on Thursday, but there are still ways of getting him into an England team that uses a different system to Liverpool.  Gareth Southgate sometimes plays with wing-backs, and I can only see Alexander-Arnold flourishing there, coming at teams from deep. It probably won't make much difference to England who plays right-back in their next two World Cup qualifiers, against Albania and San Marino in the next 11 days. They will win anyway. But in the tighter games against better opposition, Trent is a weapon that should not be wasted. He can make the difference with those brilliant runs and crosses that so few other players can produce. He is so quick and his ability on the ball is as good as it gets, so I am not surprised he has so many assists for Liverpool - England should really be making the most of his talent to make goals too. Liverpool made it look very easy against Atletico on Wednesday but that was down to a very good all-round team performance. As happens so often at Anfield, the crowd played a big part too. You could argue that by now you almost expect a fantastic atmosphere on occasions like this, but it is the way the crowd behaves that is so important, not just the fact they are noisy. I've seen it so many times before - Wednesday was not just a European night, it was a European night where the crowd think they are up against a really good side and it could be tight. So there is that tension in the air, which I think the top players love because it is another signal that a game is a little bit special, and different from the norm. You saw them all respond to that against Atletico, not just Alexander-Arnold - I could go through the whole team and they all impressed me. Liverpool have won four out of four games in what looked a tricky group and are guaranteed to finish top. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp could not ask for a better outcome than that, and it will allow him to rest players in their final two group games if he needs to. It kept their unbeaten start to the season gong too, something I think is hugely important for the team to maintain their current momentum. Of course there have been a couple of wobbles along the way, especially defensively. Atletico's damage-limitation approach after going down to 10 men so early meant we did not see if Liverpool have tightened up at all after leaking goals in their draw against Brighton at the weekend. Klopp has got some niggling injuries to contend with too, especially in midfield, so his side are not in an entirely perfect place. Let's just remember they haven't lost yet, though. In fact they have not been beaten for 25 games, since 6 April. So, while we can talk about areas where they can improve, I don't think they are doing too much wrong - and we saw against Atletico how good they are when they get things right.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59142104"},
{"title": "Dynamo Kyiv 1-2 Bayern Munich: Robert Lewandowski & Kingsley Coman score", "content": "Robert Lewandowski scored for the ninth successive Champions League game as Bayern Munich maintained their 100% record in Group E against Dynamo Kyiv. The Poland striker gave Bayern - eight points clear of Barcelona in the group - the lead with an overhead kick. Kingsley Coman, who scored the winner in the 2020 final against Paris St-Germain, slotted home the second.  Denys Harmash scored Kyiv's first goal of this year's tournament but they were unable to find an equaliser.  Bayern were without Joshua Kimmich, Serge Gnabry, Jamal Musiala, Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting and Michael Cuisance after the five players were in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.  German newspaper  Bild has reported  that those players will not be paid during their quarantine period. The 2020 winners started slowly but Lewandowski's instinctive finish changed the mood and was a moment of brilliance typical of the striker.  A cross from the right popped up off a defender's leg and the airborne striker volleyed home with his left foot. The goal meant the 33-year-old became the first player to score in nine successive Champions League games twice, having also done it in August 2020. Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo have both achieved the feat once.  Kyiv, who were unable to progress after picking up just one point in their first four games, hit the post at 1-0 when a Leon Goretzka back-pass was missed by Manuel Neuer as he attempted to clear. France winger Coman made it 2-0 just before half-time when he latched on to a Corentin Tolisso pass on the right wing and slotted into the top corner.  Kyiv were excellent after the break, forcing Neuer into an early save, before substitute Harmash finished off a clever move to reduce the deficit. They pushed for an equaliser, with captain Serhiy Sydorchuk seeing an effort from just outside the area saved and Viktor Tsyhankov grazing the outside of the post with a left-footed effort from distance.

The Norwegian boss was sacked  after Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Watford and a dreadful sequence of results.  He guided the club to second and third-placed Premier League finishes in his tenure but they are currently eighth, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. \"I look back at every single second here with pride,\" Solskjaer told MUTV. \"I think everyone knows I've given everything for this club. I wanted us to take the next step to challenge for the league, to win trophies, but unfortunately I couldn't get the results we needed and it's time for me to step aside.\" Solskjaer, 48, replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis in December 2018. He was then handed the job full-time in March 2019 on a three-year contract and, in July, signed a new deal with the club until 2024. Solskjaer was United's fourth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 - and lasted longer than more experienced predecessors David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho. However, while United finished second last season, they were a distant 12 points behind champions Manchester City and then lost the Europa League final to Villarreal on penalties.  \"We were so close in Europe,\" added a visibly emotional Solskjaer. \"Sometimes that's the fine margin for you, one penalty. We were close and that's something I'll always remember as well. I know the foundation is there, I know they're ready to kick on and I'm sure they will.\" While the club's recruitment under the former Molde and Cardiff boss has been more in tune with the expectations of supporters -  with Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane arriving at Old Trafford and Cristiano Ronaldo also returning in the summer -  performances have been very poor.  Even prior to the 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool on 24 October and the shambolic 2-0 defeat by Manchester City on 6 November, a number of question marks had already surfaced around the lack of a consistent playing style and tactics.  Despite that, Solskjaer is convinced that the club can bounce back quickly.  \"The board and the owners have backed me in bringing good people in, good players in, and I think, or I know, I leave this club with a better squad,\" he continued.  \"Hopefully, the next manager comes in and I want to support him, I want him to be successful. Hopefully I've laid the foundations for that to happen because I know I'm good at what I'm doing.\" United travel to Spain to face Villarreal in a crucial Champions League fixture on Tuesday, before league games against Chelsea and Arsenal.

{"title": "Manchester City 4-1 Club Bruges: Pep Guardiola's side edge closer to Champions League last 16", "content": "537 Raheem Sterling ended his 12-game goal drought to wrap up an easy Champions League win for Manchester City over Club Bruges at Etihad Stadium. Sterling converted Ilkay Gundogan's cutback to score for only the second time this season and claim his first Champions League goal in more than a year. With Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez finishing off Joao Cancelo crosses from close range either side of the interval and Gabriel Jesus rolling a shot into the far corner with the final kick of the game, Pep Guardiola's men were finding winning form after successive defeats by West Ham and Crystal Palace.  The only blot on a routine victory was a freak own goal by John Stones two minutes after City had taken the lead, Bernardo Silva slicing a clearance into the defender's face and then the net. City replace Paris St-Germain at the top of Group A after the French side  drew 2-2 at RB Leipzig , and require a single point from their remaining two group games to seal a spot in the last 16 for the ninth successive season. Guardiola was sufficiently confident of victory that he made all five substitutes long before the end, which included giving a home European debut to 19-year-old forward Cole Palmer, who brought an excellent late save out of former Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet. By the final whistle the City supporters' minds were already turning to their Saturday lunchtime trip to Manchester United, where they have lost only twice in eight visits during Guardiola's time in charge. A lot has been made of the form of Kevin de Bruyne and Jack Grealish recently. Grealish survived the weekend loss to Palace but De Bruyne did not. In the build-up to the game Guardiola defended the Belgian, saying it was impossible for a player to be at top form throughout a long career. Nevertheless, after the rare experience of successive defeats, De Bruyne's absence against his fellow countrymen - the visiting fans sang his name at one point - underlined how far off the pace he is. Grealish is still getting used to his new surroundings. But the through ball he found Cancelo with as the Portuguese lifted a first-time effort over Mignolet and against the post, was worthy of his record £100m price tag. Before Club Bruges could clear, Mignolet needed to save from Foden. As the visitors struggled to plug the gaps appearing in their defence, Cancelo crossed low and Foden tapped into an unguarded net. There was a similarity in the way City got their second. Needing all their concentration to repel repeated attacking thrusts from Grealish, Foden and Silva, that required saves from Mignolet to deny Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte, the Bruges defenders switched off as an aimless ball was delivered across the six-yard area. It meant no-one was picking up Mahrez as Cancelo floated his cross to the far post and the Algerian headed home from five yards completely unmarked.  Sterling replaced Mahrez as Guardiola began replacing half his team. The England man's City future remains in doubt but his goal will not harm his confidence, even though Gundogan's cross only required the simplest of finishes. With Jesus scoring as well, City took their tally to nine in two games against their visitors. At times, their passing was mesmerising, which will be a worry for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer given the difficulties Manchester United had in defending, not only in their record loss to Liverpool but also two Champions League meetings with Atalanta. Although they didn't display it in conceding five goals on home soil a fortnight ago, the Belgian champions' first two group results show they are a decent team and in the first half especially, City had some tricky moments. Noa Lang, Clinton Mata and Charles de Ketelaere all threatened in forward positions and although their equaliser was fortunate, given Stones had no time to react as Silva sliced a clearance into his face, from where it bounced past a helpless Ederson, had it not been for the City keeper Hans Vanaken would have scored anyway. Ultimately though, their defence could not cope once City started to move the ball quicker, as Guardiola was demanding from the touchline, although despite another setback they are still well placed to gain the consolation of a place in the Europa League play-offs.

Mats Hummels was sent off for the hosts, who went ahead from a Marco Reus penalty after a foul on Jude Bellingham. But Dusan Tadic, Sebastien Haller and Davy Klaassen scored for Ajax late on. It was no more than Ajax deserved, with Erik ten Hag's side patiently probing, first for an equaliser then for the goals that sealed their progression in the competition after the break.  However, Dortmund will lament that Hummels and Bellingham both missed excellent chances to score with close-range headers and appeared to have cause for complaint over the dismissal of their veteran defender after 29 minutes.

{"title": "Villarreal 0-2 Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho goals seal last-16 spot", "content": "1434 Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick dedicated victory over Villarreal to former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as United booked their place in the Champions League last 16. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho gave Carrick a win in his first game in temporary charge two days after  Solskjaer was sacked. \"It's not been an easy couple of days for anyone at the club and that result almost feels like it's for Ole,\" said Carrick, a Champions League winner with United as a player in 2008. \"We had a job to do and things needed to be taken care of. I was happy to do it and thankfully it all went to plan. \"When you've suffered results-wise and aren't in good form, individually and as a team, it's not easy to come out and let everything click - we had to show some character and fight.\" Ronaldo maintained his record of scoring in every game in this season's competition when he lifted the ball over goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 78th minute, after Fred had dispossessed Etienne Capoue. Sancho then sealed the victory in injury time, blasting a shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar. However, United were indebted to goalkeeper David de Gea as he produced two superb one-handed saves, one in each half, to keep out well-struck efforts from Manu Trigueros when it was goalless. United will progress as group winners with a game to spare after Atalanta could only draw 3-3 with Young Boys in the later game on Tuesday. The result delighted United's travelling fans, with Carrick hugging his players at the final whistle as some of the gloom over the club lifted. A bad run of form has left them eighth in the Premier League, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea, with Solskjaer's three years in charge coming to an end after an embarrassing 4-1 defeat by Watford on Saturday. Carrick, Solskjaer's assistant, said on Monday he was not thinking about a chance to impress and earn the role on a full-time basis. Before the game in Spain, former team-mate Paul Scholes, now a BT Sport pundit, was scathing of Carrick and fellow coaches Kieran McKenna and Mike Phelan, saying: \"I would be embarrassed being on the staff now. \"They all should have gone - sacked or gone off their own back. They have let the club down as much as Ole has.\" United have said they are looking to appoint an interim boss until the end of the 2021-22 campaign before potentially hiring a full-time manager after that. Earlier on Tuesday, former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said he was \"so happy\" at current club Paris St-Germain and that he would not be distracted by links to the United job. During the match, it was revealed former Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde had been contacted about the role of interim manager. However, despite the off-field distractions and criticism, United secured their first clean sheet in 15 matches - only their second of the season - and whoever takes over will have Champions League football to look forward to in February. Solskjaer scored the winning goal for United in the 1999 Champions League final and, despite losing his job, remains a club legend and was still sung about by their fans. Without him, Carrick made four changes from the 11 that began the loss to Watford, as Donny van de Beek was handed his first start in two months and Bruno Fernandes dropped to the bench. Villarreal, managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, are 12th in La Liga, having only won three of 13 domestic league matches, but were the better side in the first half and start of the second. In a repeat of last season's Europa League final, which Villarreal won 11-10 on penalties in Solskjaer's solitary final as United boss, the hosts had good chances to take the lead. Yeremi Pino fired into the side netting, Trigueros twice forced excellent one-handed saves from De Gea and Arnaut Danjuma twice shot over the bar as United came under pressure. But Ronaldo, whose 95th-minute goal gave United a 2-1 win against Villarreal in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in September, again made the difference with his sixth goal of this season's competition. Rulli's clearance found Capoue, but the former Tottenham and Watford midfielder lost the ball to Fred, and it then fell to Ronaldo with the Portuguese forward quickly lifting it over Rulli for United's first. Fred was again involved in United's second goal as he began the move, also involving substitutes Marcus Rashford and Fernandes, with the ball ending up at Sancho's feet. The England international struck powerfully past Rulli for his first goal since his £73m summer move from Borussia Dortmund to clinch the victory and a last-16 place.

Messi had a shot tipped onto the post and tapped the rebound into an empty net - and then scored a Panenka penalty to win the game. PSG won a penalty deep into injury time, but instead of Messi stepping up for a hat-trick, Mbappe took it instead - and skied it over the bar. Mbappe, who had scored his previous 11 spot-kicks for PSG, said he told Messi to take the first penalty. \"It's normal, it's respect,\" the France forward said. \"He's the best player in the world, it's a privilege he plays with us, I've always said it.

{"title": "Cole Palmer: Man City boss Pep Guardiola calls for patience over midfielder", "content": "Judging by his latest comments, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola must be as good a chef as he is a football manager. After watching 19-year-old Cole Palmer become the latest City academy graduate to grab the headlines by scoring his first Champions League goal against Club Bruges on Tuesday, Guardiola compared player development to cooking. \"The people in this world want things immediately, quick, but everything needs time,\" he said. \"You cannot cook a good dish if you don't spend time in the kitchen. So, take time.\" Palmer had only been on the pitch for two minutes when he produced a brilliant finish for City's fourth  in their 5-1 win  in Belgium. The midfielder has been used sparingly this season. He started the 1-0 defeat by Leicester in the Community Shield on 7 August and has since made four appearances off the bench - two in the Premier League and one in a 6-1 League Cup win against Wycombe, in which he also scored. \"Cole has a special quality,\" said Guardiola. \"Inside the box he has this talent which is difficult to find. When he has the ball there, most of the time it finishes in the net. \"But I know how it works with young players. We are calm and patient, like we have been with Phil Foden as well.\" Patience has certainly paid off with Guardiola's handling of Foden, who was one of the star performers on Tuesday. The 21-year-old also took time to cement his place in Guardiola's first team but is now firmly established as one of the Premier League champions' best players. Even in the unfamiliar role as a false nine he excelled, making clever runs and playing a number of brilliant passes, including a sublime assist to set up Joao Cancelo for City's first goal. Riyad Mahrez (two) and Kyle Walker also scored for the Blues, with Hans Vanaken netting for the hosts as they briefly clawed their way back to 4-1 down. Victory means City have six points in Group B, putting them second behind leaders Paris St-Germain, who have seven points. It was also the perfect response to the 2-0 defeat they suffered at PSG in their previous outing in the competition. \"It was a really good performance - one of our best performances in Europe,\" said Guardiola. \"We controlled the game and our pressing was good.

{"title": "Liverpool and Atletico serve up Champions League classic", "content": "It was a game that began with fireworks and ended without a handshake. Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone's decision to head down the tunnel without shaking the hand of Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp was perhaps not the most dignified ending to Tuesday's match, but it took nothing away from what was a frantic and ferocious Champions League encounter. In the BT studio, former Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said Simeone had \"let himself down\" and ex-Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott called it \"cowardly\". But both managers were quick to play down the absence of the traditional post-match show of respect before anything more could be made of it. Klopp described it as \"nothing\", adding to BT Sport: \"His reaction was like mine (when Atletico knocked Liverpool out at Anfield in 2020) not too good. He was obviously angry, not with me but the game, the world.\" Simeone concurred. \"I don't normally greet after the game,\" he said. \"I do not like it and I think it is not healthy because there will always be someone who is not satisfied with the game. They have a different culture, which I do not share.\" Both said they would shake hands at the return leg at Anfield in two weeks' time. What neither would want to play down was the quality, intensity and brilliance of the game at the Wanda Metropolitano - a stadium that has seen Liverpool win the Champions League in 2019, lose 1-0 seven months later in a game that contributed to the end of their title defence, and now this classic. It swung one way - with Liverpool taking a two-goal lead after 13 minutes through Mohamed Salah and Naby Keita - and then back again, with Antoine Griezmann's double restoring parity before the break. The France forward was at the centre of another twist, with his probably unintentional but dangerous high boot on Roberto Firmino drawing a straight red and giving Atletico 38 minutes to hold on with 10 men. It was then a tale of two penalties. A clumsy foul on Diogo Jota allowed Salah to score his second to make it 3-2 before the Portugal forward was initially penalised for leaning on Jose Maria Gimenez in the box at the other end. A VAR-inspired check at pitchside by the referee later and Atletico's lifeline was taken away, allowing the Reds to make it three wins from three in Group B. \"A tough game, which we expected,\" said Klopp. \"We did surprisingly well at the beginning. Did we expect it to be that offensive? Probably not. It was not so easy. We scored two wonderful goals then played good football. \"It was 2-0 then obviously Atletico are not too bothered about having possession. The first goal we gave away then the second, it was nice play but the gaps we had there... that was not alright.  \"At half time I think everyone in the stadium thought it was only going one way and we thought 'let's give it a proper try again'. \"We played a really solid second half in a tough game with intense football from both teams. \"The dirty three points are often the most important and they were dirty tonight. That wasn't our best football but it was an important step.\" On the subject of the two penalties and the red card, Klopp added: \"I understand that Atletico people or Spanish people are upset by some of the decisions but I think our penalty is a clear penalty. And the penalty for Atletico is not a penalty but I was a bit surprised they took it back. \"The red card - of course it's unlucky but I think it's a red card. The foot is in the face.\" Former Reds defender Mark Lawrenson, acting as summariser on BBC Radio 5 Live, was understandably impressed with the game and also with the continued resilience of his old side. \"Where do you start with this?\" he said. \"First and foremost, Liverpool have won, and that's the most important thing.  \"They played really well first 20 minutes and then were poor to end up at 2-2. Just a fabulous game. We've seen everything that can happen in a football game.  \"Liverpool had a few problems, but they've won and you can't take that away from them. \"It's massive.

The visitors were slick and confident from start to finish as they moved to within one point of Group A leaders Paris St-Germain with their second win in the competition. City had been dominant from the outset but their opening goal did not arrive until the 30th minute when Joao Cancelo latched onto Phil Foden's brilliant ball to slot through the legs of former Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. Mahrez then added a second from the penalty spot just before the break after he had been fouled. City did not ease up in the second half and the third goal arrived quickly as Mahrez found Kevin de Bruyne, whose one-touch ball sent Kyle Walker through and the full-back fired into the far corner. Nineteen-year-old academy graduate Palmer then scored his side's fourth just two minutes after coming onto the pitch, bending a fine shot into the back of the net from the edge of the box. Hans Vanaken turned home a late cross for the hosts but City responded immediately to get their fifth, Mahrez running through before finishing coolly one-on-one. The victory for City was the ideal response to defeat at PSG in their previous Champions League outing as they moved onto six points from three games. After losing 2-0 at PSG on 28 September, Guardiola had shown his determination to get back to winning ways quickly in the Champions League by naming a strong XI for the trip to Belgium. The one thing that did raise an eyebrow, however, was the decision to play Foden as a false nine in what was his first start in the competition this season. Guardiola had previously said that finding a position for Foden would never be a problem because he could effectively play anywhere and once again the England international repaid his manager's huge faith in him to deliver in any role. His runs and link-up play were excellent throughout and it was of little surprise that he played a key role in the opener. It is hard for words to do Foden's assist justice as, from just inside the Club Bruges' half, he spotted Cancelo's run and played an inch-perfect ball for his team-mate to run onto, control superbly and then finish. Foden flourishing under Guardiola after progressing from the academy will no doubt delight City fans and Palmer suggested he, too, could be on course to follow in Foden's footsteps. His first goal in Europe showed composure beyond his years as he became only the third teenager to score in the Champions League for Manchester City, after Foden and Kelechi Iheanacho.

{"title": "Atletico Madrid 2-3 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah stars against 10-man Atletico", "content": "1984 Mohamed Salah continued his superb form as Liverpool made it three wins out of three in the group stage of the Champions League by beating Spanish champions Atletico Madrid in a game of constant drama. In a frantic, fantastic match in the Spanish capital between sides that were dazzling in attack but vulnerable at the back, the Reds saw an early two-goal lead wiped out by Antoine Griezmann's double. The France forward was then shown a straight red card early in the second half, allowing the visitors to reassert their authority and snatch a big win through Salah's well-taken penalty, awarded for a clumsy barge on Diogo Jota by Mario Hermoso. Jota almost turned villain, though, as his challenge on Jose Maria Gimenez resulted in a penalty being awarded - only for the referee to change his mind after being encouraged by VAR to view the incident on the pitchside monitor. Earlier, Salah had given the Reds the lead when his low finish at the end of a weaving run found the net off the toe of James Milner before Naby Keita's brilliant volley doubled the visitors' advantage. Griezmann's neat close-range finish then superb turn and shot across Alisson restored parity, all before the break. But the last word went to Salah, who is now Liverpool's record goalscorer in the Champions League - his two goals taking him to 31, one more than Steven Gerrard. Jurgen Klopp's side are now unbeaten in 21 games in all competitions and continue to provide an attacking threat opponents are rarely able to deal with. In their last nine matches they have racked up 30 goals and have scored at least three times in all of their seven away games this campaign. They now top Champions League Group B by an emphatic five points after their most impressive win so far. It did not however impress Atletico boss Diego Simeone, who spent the game either whipping the home crowd up into a frenzy or berating the officials and then headed off down the tunnel at full time without shaking the hand of Klopp. There is something about Liverpool and the Wanda Metropolitano. It was on this ground in the Spanish capital that they won Europe's top club prize for the sixth time in 2019 - although that was followed by a 1-0 first-leg loss to Atletico in the stadium the following season that contributed to the end of their trophy defence. After this remarkable game against La Liga's champions, they now they have another memorable encounter to add to the list. It is a cliche to suggest a game had everything, but you would be hard pressed to work out what this action-packed and at times controversial match did not showcase. There were elite forwards providing attacking brilliance, with Salah again offering evidence to back up his manager's claims that he is currently the best player in the world. His goal owed much to Milner's touch, but the close control and skill to make space for the shot was of the level recently witnessed to a similar end result against Manchester City and Watford. At the other end, Griezmann was just as ruthless, with his second goal in particular a showcase of his intelligent movement and finishing prowess as he left Virgil van Dijk in his wake following fine work by Joao Felix. There was a long VAR check on the former Barcelona striker's first goal, but the officials must have decided Thomas Lemar did not obstruct Joel Matip after being offside from Koke's initial shot. The red card that ended Griezmann's game was a debatable one, but his boot was certainly high and while unlikely to be intentionally dangerous it was out of control. Scattered in among all this drama was some fine goalkeeping from Alisson, who excelled on his return to the side with a string of fine saves, albeit he also almost gifted Atletico a 3-2 lead of their own before the break with a clearance that struck Matip. Finally, to the penalties - one correctly given, one controversially not. Hermoso can have no complaints over the decision to punish his clumsy foul on Jota, but the Liverpool forward's light but similar challenge on Gimenez in the box at the other end could easily have cost his side. The referee's decision to overturn his on-field call reprieved Jota - who had been caught on the wrong side from a free-kick - and helped Liverpool secure a victory that takes them to the brink of the knockout stages of Europe's elite club competition.

The holders lost their last game against Juventus in Turin but there was no mistake here as the Swedes were completely outclassed.  Andreas Christensen put Chelsea ahead early on with his first goal in 137 appearances for the club from Thiago Silva's pass and Jorginho doubled the lead from the spot after Lukaku was fouled by Lasse Nielsen, the forward limping off with what looked like an ankle injury.  Werner pulled up with hamstring trouble before half-time, but Chelsea's progress continued smoothly as his replacement Callum Hudson-Odoi set up another substitute Kai Havertz for a neat finish for their third just after the break.  Malmo were over-powered and Jorginho scored from the spot again after 57 minutes following Eric Larsson's foul on Antonio Rudiger, with replacement keeper Ismael Diawara having no more success than Johan Dahlin did in the opening half.  This was the most comfortable of nights for Chelsea as they put the misery of their loss to Juventus behind them in emphatic fashion.  The Italians remain three points ahead of Chelsea in Group H, but still have to visit Stamford Bridge.  The Blues were in a different class to their Swedish opponents and effectively settled matters in the 48th minute when Havertz chipped home a composed third goal.  Manager Thomas Tuchel will be highly satisfied with how Chelsea handled this straightforward task against Malmo in a professional and ruthless manner.  They remained in control throughout with their outstanding passing and efficient movement of the ball. The win, however, was overshadowed by those injuries to Lukaku and Werner.  Lukaku was hurt as he was brought down by Nielsen for Jorginho's first penalty, seemingly taking the full weight of the Malmo player on his ankle. The club's record signing required lengthy treatment and despite walking to the halfway line in an attempt to carry on, he was clearly struggling and substituted.  Werner clutched his hamstring racing into the area and, again, was taken straight off.  Chelsea's next game is at home to the Premier League's bottom club Norwich City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, and Tuchel confirmed Lukaku and Werner will be out for \"some matches\". He must now hope this impressive victory does not come at too much of a cost to his side. Kai Havertz Formation    3-4-2-1 Formation    3-5-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58972948"},

{"title": "Manchester United: It's time for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to prove himself as an elite-level manager - Micah Richards", "content": "Part of the problem for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is that there is an over-reaction to every Manchester United win - and also every defeat. That's down to the size of the club and United's recent history, when they won so much. Expectations are so high that when they don't perform there is always going to be a backlash. The first few weeks of this season have been the perfect example of that - for good and bad. When United have won games, some people have been talking about how they are going to win the title. But when they lose, it is a total disaster and Solskjaer apparently has to go. In reality, things are not as extreme either way and, if you look at the top of the Premier League table and see how everyone else has dropped points too, you can see there is no need at all for any alarm bells to be going off at Old Trafford. Solskjaer is not the only manager who has to deal with this, though. Even Pep Guardiola was being questioned before Manchester City played Chelsea at the weekend, because he had lost his past three games against them. But while Guardiola only had to remind everyone of what a good manager he is - which he did  in some style on Saturday  by the way - the difference with Solskjaer is that he still has to prove himself as a tactician at the elite level. Solskjaer's record in the Champions League, where he has lost seven out of 11 matches in charge, only fuels his doubters and United's defeat against Young Boys in their opening group game of this campaign added to the pressure he faces every time his side play in Europe. There is an added edge to Wednesday's home game against Villarreal too. As well as needing a win to get back on track in Group F, United fans will want to see evidence of improvement and progress since  they lost to the Spanish side  in the Europa League final at the end of May. That game was only four months ago. But, like City's game with Chelsea was seen as a gauge of where they have learned or changed since losing to Thomas Tuchel's side in the Champions League final, Solskjaer will be expected to have found solutions to what went wrong that night. United played poorly and we expected a lot more from them. It will be intriguing to see what ideas he comes up with, but he won't be able to say he didn't have the options to change the game from the bench this time. In Gdansk, Solskjaer did not use any of his substitutes until the final was into extra time, but since then he has added players of the calibre of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho to his squad, which is just frightening.  The quality and strength in depth Solskjaer now has means there can be no more excuses. He has to take them to the next level and the only way to do that is by delivering a trophy. He has done a brilliant job so far to bring the feel-good factor back to the club which was missing when he took charge, but that was almost three years ago. Not many managers would get three years at a club as big as United without winning anything. I don't see his job as being in danger now and it shouldn't be. I really want to see his United team given a proper run because they have looked devastating at times. But he is going to be judged at the end of the season on his success, or lack of it, and if he is going to win something, he needs to find the right system for the players he has got. At the moment it feels like Solskjaer is trying to fit all his best attacking players into his team, even if it is in a position that doesn't suit them. I can understand why he wants to play them, but it feels like there is no balance to the side at times, such as when Paul Pogba is on the wing and Sancho is on the bench. He needs Pogba's creativity, but he also wants to include Mason Greenwood because he has started the season so well. And he is not going to drop Ronaldo is he? It also feels like Solskajer can't put his finger on what his preferred playing style is. Playing counter-attacking football has got him so far, but he still hasn't won anything. When the onus has been on United to break teams down, that has rarely worked out. He played Scott McTominay and Fred in Saturday's home defeat against Villa and I don't know if you need two defensive midfielders in a game like that. What is the benefit when you have got so much talent elsewhere? It is down to Solskjaer to solve all of these problems, but he has struggled to do it in the past, which is why he still has something to prove. In the past, in his time with United, every time there has been some adversity he has got through it, but has not pushed on afterwards.  If he is going to keep his job long term and be considered an elite manager, that also needs to change.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58700033"},

{"title": "Sheriff Tiraspol: Champions League team from an unrecognised state", "content": "\"Ask not what Trans-Dniester can do for you - ask what you can do for Trans-Dniester.\" We're driving down Andriy Smolensky's favourite street. It's the only one in Tiraspol that doesn't cause his Land Rover to bounce and rattle over potholes and broken concrete. \"They've used a new technology to make it like this,\" he says, almost proudly. \"I could drive up and down it all day.\" The tiny de facto republic of Trans-Dniester - sometimes known as Transnistria - is a place frozen in time. In its capital Tiraspol, the hammer and sickle motif of the former USSR is proudly displayed on billboards and government buildings. A huge statue of Lenin looks on from a plinth outside parliament, a mark of the pride and nostalgia the city feels for its Soviet past. The present brings pride, too.  On Tuesday night, the city's football club - FC Sheriff Tiraspol - pulled off one of the biggest Champions League shocks of all time,  beating 13-time European champions Real Madrid. This is their first season in Europe's biggest club competition - and two games into the group stage they have a 100% record after an earlier win over Shakhtar Donetsk. As Sheriff step into the unknown, so too does elite European football. This is the first time the Champions League has been played in one of Europe's 'unrecognised' de facto republics. In international law, Trans-Dniester, a thin sliver of land on the border with Ukraine, belongs to the Republic of Moldova, a country formed in 1991 as the Soviet Union was collapsing. In 1992, Russian-backed forces fought a separatist war here. When it was over, close to a thousand people had been killed, and the land east of Moldova's Dniester river had seceded to form a self-declared new state that remains unrecognised by the international community. Trans-Dniester takes its 'independence' from Moldova seriously. It uses its own currency, the Trans-Dniestrian rouble, which cannot be obtained or exchanged anywhere else in the world, and which sits outside the international banking system. In Tiraspol, phone signals from Moldova don't register, despite the 'border' being only 20km away. The territory has a reputation for corruption, organised crime and smuggling. American foreign policy think-tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described it as \"a haven for smugglers\". Millions of dollars of contraband are believed to have been moved across its border with Ukraine in recent years. Yet in Tiraspol, buildings are crumbling and the roads are cracked. The capital is a picture painted in Soviet grey. Smolensky used to work here as a broadcaster, transmitting Russian-funded German-language programmes to Europe and the United States that \"spread the message\" of what Trans-Dniester is trying to achieve. Before that, he was employed by the territory's biggest private firm, the Sheriff Company. He worked on immigration papers for overseas signings at the company's football club, FC Sheriff Tiraspol. The Champions League debutants have played in Moldova's football league since 1999. They are kings ruling over a peasant land. The Sheriff Company annual turnover is almost double the state budget, and it funds the club directly from its vast wealth reserves. The rest of Moldovan football is impoverished by comparison. While the rest of the top division play on sports pitches rented from municipal authorities, Sheriff's home is a specially constructed $200m (£154m) arena on the outskirts of Tiraspol. They have won 20 of the 22 league titles they have contested. The name Sheriff is synonymous with power in Trans-Dniester. The Sheriff Company was founded in 1993, ostensibly as a charity with the aim of providing financial assistance to veterans of the local state police in the immediate post-Soviet era. Today, it dominates everything from food retail to banking, from the media to politics. While nominally a private business concern, in December 2020 it won an overwhelming majority in the local parliament through its political party, Obnovlenie - Renewal. There is no formal connection between the Trans-Dniestrian government and FC Sheriff, but its position of political and economic strength is steadfastly secure. But the football club haven't always had things their own way. Petr Lulenov is a member of the Trans-Dniestrian Football Federation. He says that, before victory in this season's Champions League qualifiers, Sheriff's blueprint for European success had been failing for years. \"It was the business model of the club to sign foreign players from South America and from Africa, add to their value and then sell them to Russian clubs,\" says Lulenov. But owing to the weakness of the domestic league and the subsequent lack of competition, the model wasn't sufficient for raising players' standards. \"It was also hoped that teams from Russia and Ukraine would come and use the club's facilities and that that would help create big football rivalries,\" says Lulenov. \"But it isn't the way it's turned out. The football club is run at a massive loss.\" Instead of transfer fees, the current squad have shown their value for Sheriff on the pitch. Of the XI that started their Champions League play-off first-leg win against Dinamo Zagreb, 10 had been signed since the end of the club's previous European campaign 12 months earlier. Sheriff have rarely relied much on local talent, but a recent relaxation in the Football Federation of Moldova's regulations regarding homegrown quotas has freed the club up to pack out their squad with signings from abroad. In 2019, the club had 11 Moldovan passport-holders on their books; this season, it's just six. Two of them are backup goalkeepers, while another two are fringe players fresh out of the club's academy.  Instead, the team is a patchwork of nationalities and cultures. The Champions League squad features players from Malawi, Trinidad & Tobago, Uzbekistan, Ghana, Brazil, Luxembourg and Peru. Taken in the context of Trans-Dniester's unusual political status, there is little sense in which Sheriff truly represent Moldova. Speaking to ordinary people on either side of the Dniester river, the view seems to be that the partition of the country serves nobody but the political elite. That is a position echoed by authorities in Ukraine. Yulia Marushevska, head of the Odessa regional customs division, said in 2016: \"[The situation] is suitable for contrabandists, and for high-ranking officials in Chisinau and Kiev. \"This is a matter of political will, both for the Ukrainian authorities and for the Moldovan authorities.\" Since the crisis in Ukraine that began in 2014, there has been a tightening of border controls. In July 2017, a customs post, jointly operated by Ukrainian and Moldovan authorities, was set up at the border village of Pervomaisc-Kuchurgan. The European Observatory on Illicit Trade (Eurobsit) estimates that 70% of the illegal trade passing through Trans-Dniester had previously entered and exited at this crossing, on its way to and from the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Meanwhile, a 2014 free-trade agreement between Moldova and the European Union included Trans-Dniestrian businesses in its scope, and exports have since swung dramatically away from Russia and towards Moldova and the West. It seems despite 29 years of deadlock, there are signs of greater co-operation. \"This conflict is not totally frozen, rather it is a conflict of frozen solutions,\" says Octavian Ticu, a historian and former minister in the Moldovan government. \"Moldovans have interests with Trans-Dniestrians, they deal well together in business.\" Outside of the capital, football does what it can to soothe the horrors of the past. In the town of Bendery, just a few kilometres inside the Moldovan border but under Trans-Dniestrian control, a military roadblock manned by khaki-clad soldiers beckons cars to a crawl as they flow in and out of town. A mounted tank points its barrel triumphantly at the overcast sky. Along one side Cyrillic lettering bears a call to arms: За родину! - For the homeland! Situated on the banks of the Dniester, this is a city of the crossfire. Alexandru Guzun was due to play for Bendery club FC Tighina against FC Constuctorul the day a simmering conflict broke out into war. The date was 2 March 1992. \"Can you imagine the shock of arriving in a city you know well and seeing bombs exploding in the streets?\" he says. Guzun was due to meet with his team-mates at a hotel before travelling together to the club's Dynamo Stadium home ground. That isn't the way it worked out. \"The hotel was right on the river. Because of where it is located, with Tiraspol only a few kilometres one way and the Moldovan soldiers coming from the other, we were physically in the middle of the fighting.\" Once inside the hotel, it quickly became clear that there was no way out. With bombs and shells exploding around them, Guzun and his team-mates took the only route open to them - downwards. \"We took everything we could down to the basement. Everything we needed to live. We would take it in turns to go up to the first-floor hotel restaurant to get supplies and take them back down for everyone. We were trapped there for three days,\" he said. \"On the second day of the siege, some pacifists who were on neither the Moldovan nor the Trans-Dniestrian side, came to the hotel. They erected a white flag from the top floor. These guys lived underground with us. \"We found out since that an agreement was reached between the two parties for a ceasefire to allow people inside the hotel to escape. I don't believe that could have happened without the guys who came with the white flag. \"But we still had to make it from the hotel over the bridge. Just because a ceasefire has been agreed, it doesn't mean no-one will shoot at you. Nobody would have investigated. The bridge was full of bullet holes.\" Guzun left FC Tighina at the end of that season to move to Ukraine. Most of his team-mates followed. It took years for the city to recover from the distress suffered in the first half of 1992. A ceasefire in July that year brought the conflict to an end. Back in Tiraspol, FC Sheriff's power is so entrenched they are unlikely to be surpassed by their impoverished rivals in the Moldovan league any time soon. Last season's Divizia Nationala title was wrapped up with 32 wins from the 36 games and just a single defeat, as the team romped home by a 16-point margin. A stale, uninteresting dominance prevails in the league. The hope now is that the Champions League and the visits of Real and Inter Milan will inject some much-needed excitement into the predictable spectacle of Sheriff's annual title processions.  \"The football club will never collapse,\" says Lulenov. With a TV-rights windfall from Uefa pending and the on-going backing of the Sheriff behemoth, he is probably right. But still the roads in Tiraspol are cracked. \"Peace and prosperity, that's all we want,\" says Smolensky, swerving to avoid another gaping hole in the ground. \"When you have that, everything else takes care of itself.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58729231"},

{"title": "PSG 2-0 Manchester City: 'Pep Guardiola's side the latest victims of Lionel Messi'", "content": "738 Manchester City's previous high-profile Champions League defeats have often been followed by forensic inquests into manager Pep Guardiola's over-thinking and how he sometimes defeats himself.  City's  loss to Chelsea in last season's final  was Exhibit A in this argument, a classic example of Guardiola attempting to fix something that was not broken as he went in without a holding midfielder - with expensive consequences. In Paris on Tuesday, there was no need for any talk of over-complication, and there were no fingers pointed accusingly - this was a simple case of Guardiola and City falling victim to a little genius with an impeccable sense of timing.  Lionel Messi had made, by his own stellar standards, a low-key start since joining Paris St-Germain from Barcelona, but someone was always going to pay the price for that. The Champions League is the stage Messi was acquired for. So it was with a sense of inevitability that he saved up his first goal for his biggest game so far, an encounter with his old Barcelona coach Guardiola.  And what a special goal it was. City were right in this Group A game, playing with poise and chasing an equaliser as they held possession in and around the PSG area, until the 74th minute - and the moment Paris had been waiting for. Messi made one of those typical darting runs towards the area, actually starting from the halfway line, before playing in Kylian Mbappe, who delivered the deftest of touches back into his new team-mate's path.  With a sweep of his left foot and in a style that has characterised his quite brilliant career, the Argentine picked out a perfect finish high past the helpless, motionless Ederson.  He had been somewhat on the margins until he effectively decided the game - but how many times have we seen that? It is what the all-time greats do.  It felt like the moment when Messi truly announced his arrival as a PSG player. He now has 121 Champions League goals. Barcelona 120. PSG one.  And with Messi's classic intervention, an enthralling game was done. PSG's defensive blanket, typified by the magnificent Idrissa Gueye, who scored their first goal, continued to do its job and City were out of time.  There will be a constant narrative about City's lack of a recognised striker every time they draw a blank and there is no doubt they could have done with a ruthless edge here to capitalise on so much fine approach play.  Crosses fizzed around the area, Marquinhos got his head on almost everything as PSG defended with resilience while they waited for their megastars to strike, which Messi duly did.  City were not, however, out of chances. Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva both hit the bar in a matter of seconds in the first half while PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was busy throughout.  In the end, Messi made the defining contribution and showed exactly why there is such excitement about his arrival in Paris.  \"We're going to eat good tonight, drink a glass of wine, recover and prepare for the Liverpool game [on Sunday],\" was Guardiola's sanguine assessment. City beat PSG convincingly in last season's Champions League semi-final and there was enough on show here to suggest Guardiola's team can have another serious crack at the competition that has consistently proved a curse for them even as they have collected domestic silverware at will.  In the absence of that striker, Guardiola trusted Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne to create through the middle but, through no lack of effort, it is not quite happening for the England star at club level currently.  City will regroup and will still surely qualify but there was a warning from PSG in that magical Messi moment. PSG's owners believe their new and not-so-secret weapon can bring them the Champions League trophy they think, rather like their opponents here, will truly announce them among Europe's elite.  They have signed a world-class keeper in Donnarumma, have the veteran serial Champions League winner Sergio Ramos to come into defence and have Gueye, Ander Herrera and Marco Verratti establishing solid foundations in midfield. Liverpool's former Champions League winner Gini Wijnaldum only appeared as a late substitute.  Throw in the suspended Angel di Maria alongside the big three of Mbappe, Neymar and the X-factor Messi has added - namely the gift to be unstoppable - and PSG will feel they are ready to move further up the Champions League pecking order.  City's campaign will gather momentum and Guardiola will only be disappointed they did not make the most of their moments of supremacy but they were just the latest Champions League victims of the great Messi.  And, as this was one of the specific purposes of their vast outlay to prise him away from his beloved Barcelona, PSG expect they will not be the last.

{"title": "Paris St-Germain 2-0 Manchester City: Lionel Messi scores first PSG goal in win", "content": "1047 Lionel Messi scored his first Paris St-Germain goal in stunning fashion as they beat Manchester City in an enthralling Champions League group game. Messi, making his fourth appearance for PSG since leaving Barcelona, ran from the halfway line before playing a one-two with Kylian Mbappe and leaving Ederson rooted to the spot with a lovely 20-yard shot. The roar from the Parc des Princes crowd was deafening as the Argentine, on his return from injury, added one PSG goal to the 672 he managed for Barca. Idrissa Gueye had given last season's French runners-up an early lead with an excellent drive into the top corner. City had plenty of chances to score in between those goals with Raheem Sterling's header hitting the bar and Bernardo Silva striking the woodwork from the rebound with an empty net in front of him. They also had seven shots on target but could not beat Champions League debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma in PSG's goal. The first three games of Messi's spell at PSG - which has been interrupted by injury and fitness issues - had failed to set the world alight. No goals and no assists. But this was the night that all changed as he glided across the Parisian turf, gave the ball to Mbappe and got it back with a backheel before bamboozling Ederson with his shot. That was his seventh goal in five Champions League games against teams managed by Pep Guardiola - his former Barcelona boss - and his seventh goal against City. The build-up to this match had all been about whether he would return form a knee injury which had kept him out for a couple of games. There was a huge cheer from the fans before the game as his name was read out in the starting XI. He was involved earlier in the move for the opening goal too, finding Mbappe outside the box.  Mbappe's pass was air-kicked by Neymar, with Gueye then scoring a beauty. Messi's only shot was the goal - but on a night when City made PSG work hard, the veteran did his fair share too.  Almost a third of his touches were in his own half, including when he tackled Riyad Mahrez just outside the box. Even at the end, he performed the draught excluder role in the wall for a Kevin de Bruyne free-kick - a position almost invented to defend his own free-kicks. PSG - who have won all their Ligue 1 games to date - are a different team than the one who lost both legs to City in last year's semi-final. Gueye and Marco Verratti, back from four games out injured, were excellent in central midfield - and the team defended well too to keep City out. Donnarumma, in goal, made seven saves as well as four claims or punches. Ederson in the other goal only made one save. This ended a run of four consecutive Champions League matches without a win - including both City games last season. This was City's first Champions League group defeat since September 2018, when they lost 2-1 to Lyon, a run of 18 games unbeaten. They came into the game on a high after beating European champions and Premier League title rivals Chelsea 1-0 on Saturday. And they had enough chances at the Parc des Princes to win about three games - most notably when Sterling and Bernardo hit the bar in the space of five seconds. Bernardo's chance, in particular, was a sitter with an open goal about four yards out. Guardiola's side frequently threatened to get in behind PSG's backline with reverse passes but it never paid off. Mahrez was denied by Donnarumma three times, with De Bruyne forcing the Italian into two saves - and Joao Cancelo and Ruben Dias also having shots on target. De Bruyne was lucky to even be on the pitch as he avoided a red card for standing on Gueye's leg in a challenge. City keeper Ederson only touched the ball 13 times, making one save. Donnarumma was involved 44 times in the game. This result in itself is not ruinous for City, with teams able to afford losing a Champions League game so long as they win most of their others. But will it dent their morale? We should find out on Sunday as they go to Anfield to face Liverpool.

{"title": "Real Madrid 1-2 Sheriff Tiraspol: Champions League debutants snatch win", "content": "449 Sheriff Tiraspol produced one of the great Champions League shocks as the competition's least experienced club upstaged 13-time European champions Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Sebastien Thill snatched victory for the debutants with a stunning final-minute strike, sparking scenes of wild celebration from the Moldovan champions. Jasurbek Yakhshiboev's first-half header had given them the lead before Karim Benzema levelled with a penalty. But Thill's goal was a worthy way to clinch a historic victory - the Luxembourg midfielder's half-volley reducing the home crowd to silence as it flashed past Thibaut Courtois. \"It's the best and most important goal of my career, that's for sure,\" said Thill, who was last year playing on loan at FC Tambov - a Russian club which in May was dissolved after declaring themselves bankrupt. \"The side were so brave with how we played and luckily enough I was able to score a bit of a stunner. \"After this match, we all went crazy. There are a lot of foreigners in the club, we come from all types of countries. It's our strength.\" This was not what Real had planned as the Bernabeu hosted Champions League football for the first time in 580 days, and shouts of celebration from Sheriff players were the soundtrack to a monumental upset. Sheriff captain Frank Castaneda said victory was a \"dream come true\" and that they are focused on reaching the knockout stage. \"We are dreaming of getting into the last 16 and that's our objective,\" he said. The home side dominated every facet of the game, having 76% possession and 31 shots - 11 of which were on target. But Sheriff played with supreme composure and were ruthless when presented with even a hint of a chance - scoring twice from just three shots on goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti said he was \"a little sad\" as he felt Real \"deserved to win\". \"You could say we had bad luck, we lost the game on the small details, they scored their goals on the counter-attack and from a throw-in,\" the Italian said. \"We had a lot of shots at goal but sometimes luck deserts you in games. \"Everything went well for them; everything went wrong for us.\"  The match in the Spanish capital was Sheriff's 10th Champions League fixture of the season as they came through four rounds of qualifying to reach the group stage for the first time. A milestone win against Shakhtar Donetsk earlier this month sent them top of Group D, and this remarkable triumph ensures they remain unlikely leaders ahead of illustrious opposition that also includes Italian champions Inter Milan. \"Our attention now turns to Inter and we'll work hard in order to ensure we keep getting positive results,\" Sheriff captain Castaneda said. While they are still minnows on the European stage, they have won 20 of the 22 Moldovan league titles they have contested, and in the two league games before heading to Madrid, they scored 11 goals and conceded none. Tuesday's result means they become just the second club to win on their first Champions League trip to the Bernabeu, replicating Arsenal's achievement in 2005-06. And not since Leicester City in 2016-17 have a side won their opening two games on their debut in the competition. Real had intended to make history of their own on their return to the Bernabeu, which has been refurbished, as they are just one short of 100 Champions League victories at home. But the competition's most experienced club - and one which has attempted to reshape European club football as a founding member of the controversial Super League - were beaten.

Jurgen Klopp's side were superb throughout as they maintained their 100% start in the competition.  Mohamed Salah's prodded finish set them on their way at the Estadio do Dragao, which once again proved a happy hunting ground.  And with memories of 4-1 and 5-0 victories in recent campaigns fresh in the mind they delivered a performance brimming with pace, precision and energy.  Sadio Mane extended their lead on the stroke of half-time with a back-post tap in and with the Reds wearing black armbands to mourn the death of  Roger Hunt , fittingly Salah - their modern-day equivalent - contributed his second with a clinical finish into the bottom right corner.  Mehdi Taremi's header briefly gave the hosts heart but Roberto Firmino added the fourth for Liverpool with home goalkeeper Diogo Costa stranded after woefully charging up the pitch to attempt to clear.  And the Brazilian rounded off a comprehensive victory late on after pouncing on a rebound from Curtis Jones' volley. In Tuesday's other Group B fixture Luis Suarez scored a stoppage-time penalty as Atletico Madrid  won 2-1  at AC Milan. Porto and their manager Sergio Conceicao must be weary of hosting Liverpool in this competition.  The Portuguese side have now conceded 14 goals in Liverpool's last three visits to the Iberian Peninsula though they contributed to their own downfall in part with 22-year-old goalkeeper Costa culpable for two if not three of the Reds' goals.  Porto were also hampered by the loss of veteran defender Pepe and his wiles in the warm-up, while midfielder Otavio limped off early on with the score at 0-0.  And while Porto attempted to press Liverpool, whenever possible they were too often carved open by the slick football on display from Klopp's side.  It was the sort of display that if produced later in the competition would mark the Reds out as potential winners, and it was heavily influenced from midfield.  Jordan Henderson making his 400th appearance for the visitors was excellent, demanding the ball at every opportunity and combining his defensive duties with some intelligent passing and movement to set Liverpool on the attack.  But even he was overshadowed by 20-year-old Jones, who was involved in four of Liverpool's five goals and aside from central defenders Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip played more passes (72) than any other visiting player. Jones' change of pace allowed him to get a shot that diverted to Salah for the first and he showed wonderful presence of mind to slide in the Egyptian for his second. And it was his ball forward that caused confusion and embarrassment in the Porto defence for the first of Firmino's two goals.

Juventus have been struggling domestically, but were able show enough of their old guile and quality to overcome the holders in a fiercely-contested Group H encounter.  Chiesa had already threatened on the break when he flashed a shot across the face of the goal in the first half. But he gave Juve the perfect start immediately after the break when he finished high past Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy.  Federico Bernardeschi missed an open goal to double Juve's advantage and Chelsea's frustrating night was summed up when striker Romelu Lukaku missed two big opportunities to earn them a point, heading over when well placed and then shooting off target with an angled drive when he should have scored.  Kai Havertz, who scored the goal that won the Champions League against Manchester City in Porto, then wasted a glorious chance when he headed over with the last action of the game. Chelsea came up against a familiar barrier of Juventus resistance as they suffered back-to-back defeats, having lost at home to Manchester City on Saturday.  Thomas Tuchel's side dominated possession in the first half, but were unable to carve out any clear openings, with Juventus occasionally threatening on the break when Chelsea were careless in possession.  And they faced an uphill task once the lively Chiesa caught Chelsea napping with that emphatic finish right at the start of the second half. It allowed Juventus to show that familiar defensive resilience, led by a masterful performance from their peerless captain Leonardo Bonucci. Tuchel used five English substitutes - Ben Chilwell, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Trevoh Chalobah - in an attempt to spark the Blues into life.  And even though this was hardly a vintage performance and Juventus keeper Wojciech Szczesny was not forced into a serious save, Tuchel will feel Chelsea should have capitalised n a frantic closing phase when they were finally able to apply some concerted penalty-area pressure.  The service into Lukaku was poor all night, but the striker had two chances when he should have at least hit the target, directing an inviting cross from Hudson-Odoi over, and failing to test Szczesny with another attempt he normally cashes in on.  The drama continued right until the final whistle when Havertz headed over, but this was not Chelsea at their best.  They remain in a strong position in their group and should still qualify, having already beaten Zenit St Petersburg at Stamford Bridge. But Tuchel and his players will feel they have wasted an opportunity against a Juve side who have been out of sorts in Serie A as returning coach Max Allegri has made a slow start to his second spell in charge. The Italians, still coming to terms with life after Cristiano Ronaldo, will feel rejuvenated by this victory, while Chelsea will know they can do much better - yet could still have come away with a point.

{"title": "Man Utd 2-1 Villarreal: Cristiano Ronaldo scores injury-time winner", "content": "2073 Cristiano Ronaldo scored an injury-time winner as Manchester United came from behind to beat Villarreal in an action-packed Champions League Group F contest. The repeat of last season's Europa League final, which the Spanish side won on penalties, looked to be heading for a draw after another disappointing United performance but summer signing Ronaldo stroked home from Jesse Lingard's lay-off to spark jubilant scenes at Old Trafford. However, visiting manager Unai Emery will be left wondering how his side did not come away with all three points. United started brightly, with Bruno Fernandes scooping over and Ronaldo also failing to hit the target with a header in the opening seven minutes. Villarreal took charge thereafter but could not score in a first half in which they created chance after chance. United goalkeeper David de Gea made vital reflex saves to deny Arnaut Danjuma and Paco Alcacer, and also thwarted Yeremi Pino. Striker Alcacer should have scored when Raphael Varane misjudged the bounce of the ball but dragged his shot wide, and Alberto Moreno and Pino both blazed over from promising positions. But they did break the deadlock at the start of the second half as Danjuma got in behind and pulled the ball back for Alcacer to convert from close range. United were finding it difficult to make inroads but equalised through Alex Telles' moment of genius, as he smashed a first-time volley from 20 yards into the bottom corner. Ronaldo's winner means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side pick up their first win while, in the group's other tie, Atalanta beat Young Boys 1-0 to go top of the table. Brought back from Juventus in August for the big occasion, Ronaldo left it late to deliver his most telling moment since his return to Old Trafford. United were heading for a third straight game without a win - after being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by West Ham last week and beaten by Aston Villa in a limp performance on Saturday - but the Portuguese superstar had other ideas. Making his 178th appearance in the Champions League, the most of any player, Ronaldo coolly converted in the 95th minute for his fifth goal of the campaign. The home supporters erupted as the goal went in, with Ronaldo running to the corner, ripping off his shirt and throwing it into the air in celebration. Fans stayed inside the stadium long after full-time, serenading their returning hero with chants of \"Viva Ronaldo\". Though they ultimately collected three points, Solskjaer's side looked to be papering over the cracks as they once again failed to find any real cohesion in the final third of the pitch. Ronaldo, Fernandes, Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho and Paul Pogba all started in front of a raucous crowd, but there seems to be little connection between a frontline filled with attacking talent. Adding to their early misses, Fernandes flashed a shot wide and substitute Edinson Cavani somehow headed off target at the far post with a free net to aim at. The crowd became more and more disgruntled as Villarreal deservedly broke the deadlock on 53 minutes, with Alcacer sliding in from a few yards out. Gary Neville, the former United captain turned television pundit, had said after the Villa defeat that Solksjaer's side were \"delivering moments, but those moments won't go for you in certain games\". On this occasion, Telles smashing volley and Ronaldo's winner brought much-needed joy, but questions remain as to whether Solskjaer lacks a general plan, relying too much on individual inspiration in an attempt to win games. After visiting frontman Boulaye Dia almost bundled in late on, United's biggest-name individual made the difference - as Ronaldo delivered another unforgettable Champions League moment.

{"title": "Barcelona 0-3 Bayern Munich: Thomas Muller haunts Barca again as Bayern claim big win", "content": "Goals from Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski settled a battle of the big two in Champions League Group E as Bayern Munich claimed a dominant opening-game victory at Barcelona. The German champions controlled the game, with Muller scoring his seventh career goal against Barca courtesy of a first-half effort that found the net off Eric Garcia's back. Lewandowski made sure of the win with a typical predatory finish, poking his 74th Champions League goal into an empty net after Jamal Musiala's drive had cannoned back off the post. His 75th came late in the game, as he once again showed his talent in front of goal with a lashed finish after Serge Gnabry's shot had come back off the post and fell to him in the box. Barca, playing their first Champions League since the departure of talisman Lionel Messi, were flat and offered little, failing to muster a single shot on target. The Catalan side have now lost three consecutive home games in European competition for the first time in their entire history. They ended the game with four teenagers on the pitch, which did at least inject some urgency and lift a subdued crowd of just short of 40,000 because of Covid-19 restrictions. But they were still thoroughly outclassed and by a Bayern team that were not even at their best. The German side lead the group, with the other game, between Benfica and Dinamo Kiev, finishing 0-0. It is now 13 months since Bayern ruthlessly exposed the growing frailty at the heart of Barcelona,  putting eight past them  in one of the most eye-opening Champions League knockout games in recent memory. Little did Barca know that things would only get worse for them in the months to follow, with a perilous financial situation bringing about the departure of Messi to Paris St-Germain this summer. They now look a shell of a once great side - sleepwalking through the motions and vulnerable to being easily brushed aside by any side with a plan and talent, or a world-class one playing in third gear as Bayern were here. Messi started up front with Luis Suarez in that 8-2 loss in 2020. On Wednesday, Barca paired two former Premier League failures in Memphis Depay and Luuk de Jong, and that was largely because ex-Middlesbrough forward Martin Braithwaite is injured. Not that it mattered as Bayern cut the supply, left the home forwards adrift, set about pressing high, and patiently picked apart a defence designed to be a three but more often pushed into being a five. \"It is what it is,\" said Gerard Pique, one of those three centre-backs. \"We are what we are, that's the reality.\" Fellow defender Garcia was more defiant, saying: \"I think the scoreline is unfair. The first goal deflected off me, the second goal came back off the post and fell to Lewandowski. \"I don't think we should have lost by such a big scoreline. \"If we didn't hold the ball in midfield enough, at the end of the day, we were playing Bayern - maybe the best team in Europe. We knew it was going to be really tough.\" Bayern are in something of a transition phase of their own, with their immediate solution to a departing manager and aging parts of their squad being to recruit the best bits from nearest domestic challenger RB Leipzig. In new boss Julian Nagelsmann they have a man whose ideals make for an easy handover from successor Hansi Flick. The 34-year-old has the talent and the tools to make this Bayern side a real challenger for the Champions League this season. If this is them in third gear, imagine when they hit fifth? They are now undefeated in 19 European away matches - a record run in all European competitions - and will surely only get better. As for Barca, they are stalling and it is hard to see how they get themselves back on track. Second place in Group E is far from a sure thing.

{"title": "Sheriff Tiraspol: Champions League team from an unrecognised state", "content": "\"Ask not what Trans-Dniester can do for you - ask what you can do for Trans-Dniester.\" We're driving down Andriy Smolensky's favourite street. It's the only one in Tiraspol that doesn't cause his Land Rover to bounce and rattle over potholes and broken concrete. \"They've used a new technology to make it like this,\" he says, almost proudly. \"I could drive up and down it all day.\" The tiny de facto republic of Trans-Dniester - sometimes known as Transnistria - is a place frozen in time. In its capital Tiraspol, the hammer and sickle motif of the former USSR is proudly displayed on billboards and government buildings. A huge statue of Lenin looks on from a plinth outside parliament, a mark of the pride and nostalgia the city feels for its Soviet past. But on Wednesday night, it will take a giant stride towards its future. The city's football club, FC Sheriff Tiraspol, qualified for the Champions League group stage for the very first time with a play-off victory against Dinamo Zagreb in August. Their reward is a draw that will see them welcome Real Madrid and Inter Milan to Tiraspol, after Wednesday's curtain-raiser against Shakhtar Donetsk. If it marks new ground for Sheriff, then elite European football will be stepping into the unknown, too. It is the first time the Champions League will have been played in one of Europe's 'unrecognised' de facto republics. In international law, Trans-Dniester, a thin sliver of land on the border with Ukraine, belongs to the Republic of Moldova, a country formed in 1991 as the Soviet Union was collapsing. In 1992, Russian-backed forces fought a separatist war here. When it was over, close to a thousand people had been killed, and the land east of Moldova's Dniester river had seceded to form a self-declared new state that remains unrecognised by the international community. Trans-Dniester takes its 'independence' from Moldova seriously. It uses its own currency, the Trans-Dniestrian rouble, which cannot be obtained or exchanged anywhere else in the world, and which sits outside the international banking system. In Tiraspol, phone signals from Moldova don't register, despite the 'border' being only 20km away. The territory has a reputation for corruption, organised crime and smuggling. American foreign policy think-tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described it as \"a haven for smugglers\". Millions of dollars of contraband are believed to have been moved across its border with Ukraine in recent years. Yet in Tiraspol, buildings are crumbling and the roads are cracked. The capital is a picture painted in Soviet grey. Smolensky used to work here as a broadcaster, transmitting Russian-funded German-language programmes to Europe and the United States that \"spread the message\" of what Trans-Dniester is trying to achieve. Before that, he was employed by the territory's biggest private firm, the Sheriff Company. He worked on immigration papers for overseas signings at the company's football club, FC Sheriff Tiraspol. The Champions League debutants have played in Moldova's football league since 1999. They are kings ruling over a peasant land. The Sheriff Company annual turnover is almost double the state budget, and it funds the club directly from its vast wealth reserves. The rest of Moldovan football is impoverished by comparison. While the rest of the top division play on sports pitches rented from municipal authorities, Sheriff's home is a specially constructed $200m (£154m) arena on the outskirts of Tiraspol. They have won 20 of the 22 league titles they have contested. The name Sheriff is synonymous with power in Trans-Dniester. The Sheriff Company was founded in 1993, ostensibly as a charity with the aim of providing financial assistance to veterans of the local state police in the immediate post-Soviet era. Today, it dominates everything from food retail to banking, from the media to politics. While nominally a private business concern, in December 2020 it won an overwhelming majority in the local parliament through its political party, Obnovlenie - Renewal. There is no formal connection between the Trans-Dniestrian government and FC Sheriff, but its position of political and economic strength is steadfastly secure. But the football club haven't always had things their own way. Petr Lulenov is a member of the Trans-Dniestrian Football Federation. He says that, before victory in this season's Champions League qualifiers, Sheriff's blueprint for European success had been failing for years. \"It was the business model of the club to sign foreign players from South America and from Africa, add to their value and then sell them to Russian clubs,\" says Lulenov. But owing to the weakness of the domestic league and the subsequent lack of competition, the model wasn't sufficient for raising players' standards. \"It was also hoped that teams from Russia and Ukraine would come and use the club's facilities and that that would help create big football rivalries,\" says Lulenov. \"But it isn't the way it's turned out. The football club is run at a massive loss.\" Instead of transfer fees, the current squad have shown their value for Sheriff on the pitch. Of the XI that started their Champions League play-off first-leg win against Dinamo, 10 had been signed since the end of the club's previous European campaign 12 months earlier. Sheriff have rarely relied much on local talent, but a recent relaxation in the Football Federation of Moldova's regulations regarding homegrown quotas has freed the club up to pack out their squad with signings from abroad. In 2019, the club had 11 Moldovan passport-holders on their books; this season, it's just six. Two of them are backup goalkeepers, while another two are fringe players fresh out of the club's academy.  Instead, the team is a patchwork of nationalities and cultures. The Champions League squad features players from Malawi, Trinidad & Tobago, Uzbekistan, Ghana, Brazil, Luxembourg and Peru. Taken in the context of Trans-Dniester's unusual political status, there is little sense in which Sheriff truly represent Moldova. Speaking to ordinary people on either side of the Dniester river, the view seems to be that the partition of the country serves nobody but the political elite. That is a position echoed by authorities in Ukraine. Yulia Marushevska, head of the Odessa regional customs division, said in 2016: \"[The situation] is suitable for contrabandists, and for high-ranking officials in Chisinau and Kiev. \"This is a matter of political will, both for the Ukrainian authorities and for the Moldovan authorities.\" Since the crisis in Ukraine that began in 2014, there has been a tightening of border controls. In July 2017, a customs post, jointly operated by Ukrainian and Moldovan authorities, was set up at the border village of Pervomaisc-Kuchurgan. The European Observatory on Illicit Trade (Eurobsit) estimates that 70% of the illegal trade passing through Trans-Dniester had previously entered and exited at this crossing, on its way to and from the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Meanwhile, a 2014 free-trade agreement between Moldova and the European Union included Trans-Dniestrian businesses in its scope, and exports have since swung dramatically away from Russia and towards Moldova and the West. It seems despite 29 years of deadlock, there are signs of greater co-operation. \"This conflict is not totally frozen, rather it is a conflict of frozen solutions,\" says Octavian Ticu, a historian and former minister in the Moldovan government. \"Moldovans have interests with Trans-Dniestrians, they deal well together in business.\" Outside of the capital, football does what it can to soothe the horrors of the past. In the town of Bendery, just a few kilometres inside the Moldovan border but under Trans-Dniestrian control, a military roadblock manned by khaki-clad soldiers beckons cars to a crawl as they flow in and out of town. A mounted tank points its barrel triumphantly at the overcast sky. Along one side Cyrillic lettering bears a call to arms: За родину! - For the homeland! Situated on the banks of the Dniester, this is a city of the crossfire. Alexandru Guzun was due to play for Bendery club FC Tighina against FC Constuctorul the day a simmering conflict broke out into war. The date was 2 March 1992. \"Can you imagine the shock of arriving in a city you know well and seeing bombs exploding in the streets?\" he says. Guzun was due to meet with his team-mates at a hotel before travelling together to the club's Dynamo Stadium home ground. That isn't the way it worked out. \"The hotel was right on the river. Because of where it is located, with Tiraspol only a few kilometres one way and the Moldovan soldiers coming from the other, we were physically in the middle of the fighting.\" Once inside the hotel, it quickly became clear that there was no way out. With bombs and shells exploding around them, Guzun and his team-mates took the only route open to them - downwards. \"We took everything we could down to the basement. Everything we needed to live. We would take it in turns to go up to the first-floor hotel restaurant to get supplies and take them back down for everyone. We were trapped there for three days,\" he said. \"On the second day of the siege, some pacifists who were on neither the Moldovan nor the Trans-Dniestrian side, came to the hotel. They erected a white flag from the top floor. These guys lived underground with us. \"We found out since that an agreement was reached between the two parties for a ceasefire to allow people inside the hotel to escape. I don't believe that could have happened without the guys who came with the white flag. \"But we still had to make it from the hotel over the bridge. Just because a ceasefire has been agreed, it doesn't mean no-one will shoot at you. Nobody would have investigated. The bridge was full of bullet holes.\" Guzun left FC Tighina at the end of that season to move to Ukraine. Most of his team-mates followed. It took years for the city to recover from the distress suffered in the first half of 1992. A ceasefire in July that year brought the conflict to an end. Back in Tiraspol, FC Sheriff's power is so entrenched they are unlikely to be surpassed by their impoverished rivals in the Moldovan league any time soon. Last season's Divizia Nationala title was wrapped up with 32 wins from the 36 games and just a single defeat, as the team romped home by a 16-point margin. A stale, uninteresting dominance prevails in the league. The hope now is that the Champions League and the visits of Real and Inter will inject some much-needed excitement into the predictable spectacle of Sheriff's annual title processions.  \"The football club will never collapse,\" says Lulenov. With a TV-rights windfall from Uefa pending and the on-going backing of the Sheriff behemoth, he is probably right. But still the roads in Tiraspol are cracked. \"Peace and prosperity, that's all we want,\" says Smolensky, swerving to avoid another gaping hole in the ground. \"When you have that, everything else takes care of itself.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58546814"},
{"title": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: 'Manchester United will learn from Young Boys defeat'", "content": "Jesse Lingard will learn from his mistake which gifted Young Boys a famous 2-1 Champions League win over Manchester United, says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United, who had Aaron Wan-Bissaka sent off, looked set to hang on for a point in Group F in Switzerland. But a poor back pass by Lingard, who had replaced Cristiano Ronaldo, allowed  Jordan Siebatcheu to score the winner . \"We're humans, every footballer makes mistakes,\" said United boss Solskjaer. Ronaldo had given United the perfect start against the Swiss champions with his third goal in two games since re-signing from Juventus. However, right-back Wan-Bissaka was shown a straight red card before half-time for a lunging tackle on Christopher Martins.   Moumi Ngamaleu equalised before Lingard's injury-time error left United reflecting on a seventh defeat in 11 Champions League matches under Solskjaer. \"With Jesse, no footballer likes making mistakes but it's obviously part and parcel of the game,\" added Solskjaer, whose side managed just two shots during the game against a team that had to qualify for the group stage. \"We'll learn from it, he'll learn from it. He'll pick himself up and be ready to go on Sunday against West Ham.\" Lingard, 28, enjoyed a productive loan spell at West Ham last season, scoring nine times in 16 Premier League games. He has  rejected a contract offer at United  and his current deal runs out at the end of the season. United captain Harry Maguire said Lingard was not to blame for the defeat which leaves United with an uphill battle in a group containing Spanish side Villarreal and Italian side Atalanta, who drew 2-2 in Spain. United host Villarreal at Old Trafford in their next group game on September 29, a repeat of last season's Europa League final which Solskjaer's team lost on penalties. \"I'm sure everyone on that pitch today has made a mistake. I'm sure Jesse will pick himself up,\" added Maguire. \"It's the first game in the group. We've got many games to bounce back and we must do. We'll try and pick up three points in our next game and build momentum from there.\" Wan-Bissaka's red card changed the dynamics as United gradually lost momentum. United missed out on qualifying for the knockout stage in last season's Champions League after losing three of their six group matches. \"You need 10, maybe 12, points, you need to win your home games, win one away from home,\" added Solskjaer. \"Of course we've lost the opportunity to get three points but we've got two home games next and got to focus on them two. \"Lack of concentration, make a mistake and you get punished. You get done. We did that last year in Europe.  \"Today in the last seconds Jesse just wants to play it safe and just one misplaced pass and you've conceded a goal.  \"Aaron's normally a very, very astute tackler - one of the best in the world.  \"We know we've given ourselves a more difficult task than what we did last year but everyone thought we were through after two games last year.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58566412"},

The reason being that Taylor had not yet shown him his first yellow card. The incident occurred near the end of the 0-0 draw between the sides and prompted much confusion. Thankfully for Taylor, his mistake was pointed out and Garmash able to end the game with just a booking to his name.

Unfortunately for Poll, his mistake stood. In Tuesday's game, Benfica forward Roman Yaremchuk was left frustrated after spurning a number of opportunities to give his current side victory against former employer.

Lukaku, a £97.5m summer signing from Inter Milan, has already demonstrated his goal threat in the Premier League and was on the mark again with his first goal for Chelsea in the competition they won for the second time against Manchester City in June. Chelsea were made to work hard as Zenit dug in but manager Thomas Tuchel's side stepped up the pace after the interval, Lukaku breaking the deadlock when he headed in at the far post from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross in the 69th minute. The holders deserved the victory but Zenit missed a glorious chance to snatch a point when substitute Artem Dzyuba slid wide from six yards as he tried to turn in Sardar Azmoun's cross late on. Chelsea's victory was not a surprise given their status as Champions League holders and their impressive start to the season but this showed they are more than willing to do the dirty work to get the job done when required.  And it was Lukaku, the talisman, who showed once again what a difference he will make to Chelsea by providing the cutting edge they often lacked last season, even though they won Europe's elite competition in Porto.  Lukaku's chances were limited as Zenit defended well and with real resilience but he pounced on the first opportunity he was given to score with a towering header. Chelsea struggled to make any impression in the first half but it was clear Tuchel had ordered his players to move through the gears and they were much more forceful after the break.  If Lukaku is the main man in attack, it was defender Antonio Rudiger who set the tone at both ends to lift the Chelsea fans inside Stamford Bridge.  Rudiger lifted the noise levels with a surging run from inside his own half just after the re-start which ended with a shot that flashed just wide. He then made a vital challenge at the other end as Zenit's Iranian forward Azmoun threatened to give the visitors a shock lead, celebrating his interception with a fist pump to the crowd who appreciate the German's uncompromising style.  It was not Chelsea at their most impressive but, as they did against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday, this is now a side that is almost the complete package. They are a side who find a way to win and Tuchel will be delighted to get three points on the board in the Champions League, especially as the other European superpower in Group H, Juventus, started their campaign with an  impressive 3-0 win against Malmo  in Sweden.  Tuchel will know there is much more to come from a Chelsea side tipped for success at home and abroad this season and he will be more than satisfied to start with three points.

{"title": "AC Milan: Is Sandro Tonali the new Andrea Pirlo?", "content": "Sandro Tonali has been called 'the new Pirlo' ever since the start of his fledgling career - with the nickname first mentioned before he had even played a minute of senior football. So when AC Milan's 21-year-old midfielder lines up at Anfield on Wednesday for his Champions League debut, he won't be put off by such lofty expectations, even if his game is actually styled on a very different Milan legend. Tonali scored his first goal for AC Milan with a brilliant free-kick against Cagliari two weeks ago, an almost identical effort to Andrea Pirlo's debut goal for the club versus Parma back in 2002. The 'new Pirlo' tag was on everyone's lips again. It has followed Tonali from the very first time his name was mentioned in the press. In July 2017, newspaper Giornale di Brescia published a feature about the promising youngster, headlined: 'A guy born in 2000 who moves and looks like Pirlo. With hair like that, it is impossible not to notice him.' Indeed, Tonali - who was 17 at the time and yet to make the first team debut for Brescia - had almost exactly the same haircut as the 2006 World Cup winner, who started his professional career at the club in 1995 before signing for Milan and making 401 appearances for them. With Tonali playing in a similar position to Pirlo on the pitch for Brescia, it proved to be a very difficult task to erase it from people's minds - even though his role model was a completely different type of player. A diehard Milan fan, Tonali had always admired the skills of Gennaro Gattuso. After signing for the Rossoneri in the summer of 2020, following Brescia's relegation, he even personally asked his idol for permission to wear his number eight shirt - and got it.  \"The Pirlo comparisons started because of that haircut. They don't bother me, but they are not suitable. We are different on the pitch, and Pirlo had supreme qualities. I don't know who would be able to reach those heights,\" Tonali told Corriere della Sera two years ago. Pirlo himself agrees, but in a different way. In May, the former Juventus coach claimed: \"Tonali doesn't look like me as a player. He is much more complete, both defensively and offensively. He is a mix between me and other players. He is not my heir because he plays differently, but he will surely become a great footballer.\" \"The Pirlo comparison is a big misunderstanding,\" journalist Erica Bariselli told BBC Sport. \"Tonali is more powerful and dynamic, but less imaginative than Pirlo. When Pirlo was at Tonali's age, he wasn't as physically strong. Their characters are quite similar, though. Both were very sure of themselves as kids, both are reserved off the pitch, and both love to joke in the dressing room. \"Tonali is a stronger leader at Brescia than Pirlo was at his age. Like Pirlo, he is capable of providing assists and has great passing range,\" adds another journalist, Cristiano Tognoli. Tonali had always been considered a top prospect at Brescia. \"When he made his debut in Serie B, club owner Massimo Cellino asked the coach not to play him until he signed a professional contract,\" Alessandro Rodella, a writer for Italian website TifoBrescia, said. \"Cellino promised Sandro to sell him to the club of his choice, and was true to his word. Naturally, the midfielder went to Milan, and even agreed to reduce his salary to stay at San Siro this summer.\" Life at Milan hasn't always been easy for the youngster, who made just 17 Serie A starts last season. Corriere dello Sport journalist Andrea Ramazzotti said: \"He is at a big team now, and needed to gain experience. Tonali arrived with the 'new Pirlo' expectations, but after watching him in action everyone understands that he is more similar to Gattuso - he is good at recovering the ball.\"  \"Sandro might have underestimated the differences between the clubs, and wasn't mentally ready last term. It is normal for such a young player. This season, he is more confident, stopped thinking too much and started playing at his true level. This could be his breakthrough season,\" Corriere della Sera writer Carlos Passerini said. Tonali has impressed in his three starts this season, with Milan making a winning start to the campaign, and now he is ready for his Champions League debut at Anfield. Regardless of comparisons, Liverpool would always be very special opponents for a Milan fan like him. The finals between the teams in 2005 and 2007 will stay long in the memory, with Pirlo and Gattuso playing a major part in both games. Now Milan are facing their rivals for the first time in 14 years, and Tonali is out to write his own chapter.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58549032"},
{"title": "Young Boys 2-1 Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo scores but Red Devils suffer shock defeat", "content": "2903 Manchester United conceded a dramatic stoppage-time goal as they lost to Young Boys despite Cristiano Ronaldo scoring on his Champions League return for the Red Devils. Ronaldo, who became the joint all-time Champions League appearance holder on his 177th appearance in the competition, fired United ahead after an exquisite pass from fellow Portuguese Bruno Fernandes. United played for almost an hour with 10 men after Aaron Wan-Bissaka's dangerous challenge on Christopher Martins earned the defender a straight red card. They looked set to hang on for a point in an entertaining match after Cameroon winger Moumi Ngamaleu's equaliser. But a 95th-minute mistake by substitute Jesse Lingard - who had replaced Ronaldo with 18 minutes left - allowed Jordan Siebatcheu to score the winner for the team that had to come through qualifying to reach the group stage. The home fans celebrated wildly while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left to reflect on a performance which saw United muster just two shots, the fewest Opta have on record in any of their 138 Champions League matches since 2003-04.  Having missed out on qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition last season, United now host Villarreal in their next Group F game on 29 September in a repeat of last season's Europa League final. Having spent £120m on three major signings in the summer, United will have hoped to have come away with more than a hard luck tale against the Swiss champions. But Wan-Bissaka's dismissal - and Lingard's late error - left them reflecting on a seventh defeat in 11 Champions League matches under Solskjaer. Up until Wan-Bissaka's first red card since 2018, United were in reasonable control and leading after a lovely goal made in Portugal. Having scored twice on his second debut for  United against Newcastle  last Saturday, Ronaldo has three goals in two appearances since re-signing from Juventus. More importantly, the all-time Champions League top scorer now has 135 goals in the competition. Young Boys keeper David von Ballmoos will feel he should have kept it out, but the pass by Fernandes with the outside of his right foot was simply divine. Wan-Bissaka's red card prompted Solskjaer to reshuffle his side with expensive summer recruit Jadon Sancho replaced by Diogo Dalot. Having defended their lead up until half-time, Solskjaer then replaced Donny van de Beek, who was making his first start of the season, with Raphael Varane and switched to five at the back in an attempt to shore up the defence. It did not work as the home side, full of energy and spurred on by a raucous crowd, eventually made their pressure tell. After Ngamaleu's equaliser, De Gea was forced to tip Sandro Lauper's 30-yard attempt over the bar before Lingard's attempted pass back fell well short allowing Siebatcheu to earn Young Boys a famous win.

A smart run from Bellingham then teed up Erling Braut Haaland to double Dortmund's lead before the break. Javi Montero's late header for the hosts then set up a nervy finish. Haaland's strike was his 21st goal in 17 games in the Champions League across spells with Red Bull Salzburg and now Dortmund.

The Blues recorded a memorable home win over Qarabag two years ago but missed out on the Europa League group stage on  away goals after a 4-4 aggregate draw . Mulgrew was speaking ahead of his side's Champions League opener away to Zalgiris Vilnius on Tuesday. \"Focus and added belief are important,\" said the 35-year-old skipper. \"I think what we did a few years ago gave everybody belief. Look at Coleraine last year and Glentoran, teams have started to realise that once you get through a round then you never know what might happen. \"Obviously the finances that are on offer now are massive and that also probably dictates the focus that you have on Europe. I think our run in the Europa League when we beat Qarabag at home could have been a catalyst.\"    The trip to face the Lithuanian champions in the Champions League first qualifying round (18:00 BST kick-off) will be Linfield's first competitive outing since their Irish Premiership win over Cliftonville on 29 May.  The Belfast side, who clinched a league and Irish Cup double last season, have warmed up for the European campaign with friendlies against Scottish sides Kilmarnock and St Mirren over the last week.  However, despite a lack of competitive minutes in recent weeks, Mulgrew feels as though the club's switch to a full-time model will stand them in good stead as they look to break new ground in European competition.  \"Obviously we are in full time and doing the full-time programme so the couple of weeks off before doing that was great,\" added the veteran midfielder. \"It's been really good, I'm really enjoying it - I suppose you are supposed to do it when you're in your 20s and not when you're 35 but it was a no-brainer for me.  \"With the full-time regime we are able to take our time, do a stretching session or go into the gym as well as other things rather than rushing to get to training after work then maybe eating your dinner late.  \"The intensity is certainly no less but the sessions are just not as condensed as they would have been before. The boys are all really enjoying it.\" Linfield's Europa League tie with Qarabag in 2019 featured a couple of standout performances from Shayne Lavery, who scored three goals across the two legs.  However, the departure of the 22-year-old striker - who scored 30 goals during the 2020-21 season - to Blackpool in addition to Joel Cooper's return to parent club Oxford United and Andrew Waterworth's move to Glenavon has deprived boss David Healy of three of his most effective attacking players.  But the absence of those key men does not faze Mulgrew, who believes it instead offers an opportunity to the likes of Christy Manzinga, who played in the recent friendly defeats by Kilmarnock and St Mirren.  \"I have every faith in the club's recruitment team, there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes to get a couple of strikers in but that gives other players the opportunity to step up to the mark and prove they are capable of filling the shoes left by Shayne and Andy,\" said Mulgrew.  \"We have Christy there who came from Motherwell but last season had injuries and a suspension as well but he played against Kilmarnock and did well.  \"There is no doubt that there will be players coming in, obviously we are a bit light on numbers in the squad but hopefully with the addition of maybe three more players it will stand us in good stead for the league campaign starting.\" While Linfield have lost several players recently, with defenders Mark Haughey and Mark Stafford joining Waterworth at Glenavon, they issued a statement of intent by  snapping up Dundalk captain Chris Shields from Dundalk .  Former Ayr United defender Sam Roscoe, goalkeeper Jack Ruddy and youngster Andrew Clarke have also been added to Healy's squad ahead of the 2021-22 campaign. Linfield progressed through the preliminary round of last season's Champions League before losing 1-0 to Legia Warsaw.

{"title": "Liverpool 3-2 AC Milan: Reds pull off comeback in Champions League epic", "content": "1303 Liverpool had to come from behind to win a Champions League thriller against AC Milan at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's team laid siege to Milan's goal from the start, taking a deserved early lead when former Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori deflected a cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold into his own net. Liverpool, who missed the chance to double their advantage when Mohamed Salah's penalty was saved by keeper Mike Maignan, were stunned when Milan, after being completely outplayed, struck twice in the space of seconds right on half-time to take the lead through Ante Rebic and Brahim Diaz. Klopp's side regrouped to subject Milan to intense pressure once more after the break and were rewarded for their stirring comeback, Salah making amends for his penalty miss by equalising from close range after 48 minutes when he was superbly set up by Divock Origi. And as the traffic became one-way once more with Anfield turning up the volume, Jordan Henderson rifled home his first Champions League goal for seven years in the 69th minute when Milan could only partially clear a Liverpool corner to settle this richly entertaining Group B opening game. Liverpool somehow managed to transform what was, for the most part, a superb performance into a nervous night at Anfield against a Milan side who were outplayed for almost the entire game. They opened up in a manner that suggested this opening group game would be done and dusted by half-time as Liverpool created a succession of clear openings that resulted in one goal and should have brought more. Milan were handed a reprieve when Salah suffered a rare blemish from the spot with only his second failure in 19 attempts, striking his effort too close to Maignan after Ismael Bennacer handled Andy Robertson's shot. Anfield was stunned when Milan hit Liverpool twice right on the break to somehow end the first half in the lead, but it was a harsh lesson learned as they got careless in defence and were shown that any moments when you switch off will be punished in the Champions League. There was still a sense of inevitability about Liverpool's victory and, in the manner reminiscent of so many of their wins in recent years, it was sheer weight of pressure that finally wore Milan down, even if the winner did come from an unlikely source as Henderson's crisp drive gave Maignan no chance. It was no more than Liverpool deserved but it was also an early warning that sloppiness is very dangerous, even against a side who had barely been out of their own half in the first 45 minutes. In the end, it is the win that counts in a very tight Champions League group which also contains Porto and the dangerous La Liga champions Atletico Madrid. Those two blemishes apart, Klopp will be delighted with so much of Liverpool's performance. Liverpool manager Klopp has flagged up that he will use all of his squad strength this season but he may have surprised a few by restricting Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mane to the bench in an opening Champions League game where victory is always vital to gather instant momentum. Klopp is determined not to overwork Van Dijk after he missed most of last season with a serious knee injury. It allowed Joe Gomez to get 90 minutes under his belt after he suffered a similar fate to his Dutch defensive partner when he was struck down with a knee problem on England duty. Origi came in for Mane, and the player who will always be remembered at Anfield for his Champions League deeds in Liverpool's successful 2019 campaign - when he led the sensational semi-final comeback against Barcelona and scored in the final against Tottenham - made another key contribution here. He produced a superb piece of ingenuity to set up Salah for his equaliser just after the interval at a time when Liverpool needed a swift response to those two Milan sucker punches right on half-time. Origi later went off suffering from cramp, understandable given his lack of action, and Anfield showed its appreciation with a standing ovation. Salah was the beneficiary and he was once again Liverpool's talisman, a man on a mission to put matters right after missing his penalty. Klopp will continue to utilise his squad throughout this campaign but Salah will remain, as ever, absolutely central to all Liverpool's hopes in domestic competition and in the Champions League - and he delivered the goods again.

Saulius Mikoliunas was denied by a brilliant block by Linfield defender Callacher as the Lithuanians continued to press. They did double their lead three minutes before half-time when Fallon was penalised for handball from Kyeremeh's effort. The Linfield midfielder was two yards away from the shot however referee Alex Troleis awarded the spot kick and Kis calmly tucked the ball away. Sylvestr spurned an excellent opportunity to add a third form close range minutes after the restart but Linfield got a crucial goal on 54 minutes to keep the tie alive.  Fallon's shot from 25 yards was deflected and almost caught out home goalkeeper Edvinas Gertmonas, who could only push the ball out of the six yard box and Manzinga reacted quickest to fire home the rebound. Callacher pulled off another superb intervention to clear Videmont's curling cross off the line 10 minutes after Manzinga's goal, however Sylvestr's header from the resulting corner bounced off the post and crossed the line after it came back off the unfortunate Johns to restore Zalgiris' two-goal advantage. Johns redeemed himself with a diving stop to keep out Kis' lunging effort and the lively Videmont headed over from close range as Linfield, who hadn't played a competitive match since the end of May, began to tire in the closing stages.

Even under normal circumstances, the Cymru Premier champions would not have anticipated a busy away end at the Republican Stadium in Yerevan, where they faced FC Alashkert in a Champions League first qualifying round tie on Wednesday night. In Covid times, they were stunned to find one man, Mike Edgeworth, cheering them on - particularly as he had never watched them before. Edgeworth, 37, was born in England but spent around 30 years living in south Wales before moving to Poland, where he teaches English, three years ago. With his school closed for the summer, Edgeworth spotted Connah's Quay's meeting with Alashkert and decided he had to make it part of a holiday trip across eastern Europe. \"I was planning to come to Armenia as part of a summer of travelling and I love my football,\" Edgeworth told BBC Sport Wales.  \"I am a die-hard West Ham fan, but I like to support the home nations and the clubs when they are playing in Europe. \"I had to come and cheer Connah's Quay on because I thought with Covid, they wouldn't have any support here. \"I think when the players came on to the pitch, they were shocked.\" Edgeworth was significantly outnumbered, with around 3,000 home fans seeing Alashkert progress as an extra-time goal gave them a 3-2 aggregate victory.  It was an agonising defeat for a depleted Nomads side who seemed set to take the tie to penalties. Despite the disappointment, the Welsh club recognised Edgeworth's efforts by giving him a shirt. \"It's absolutely awesome,\" Edgeworth said. \"I flew from Gdansk in Poland to Georgia. I travelled through Georgia for a week. \"I then managed to get a minibus for about six hours from Tbilisi to Yerevan.

{"title": "'Celtic need to nail down a new number one or they're going nowhere'", "content": "For some Celtic fans there might have been a touch of fear about Tuesday night's Champions League qualifier against Midtjylland, not just because they were under-manned. The recent reputation of the Danish side might have caused some anxiety, too. Good enough to make the Champions League group stage last season. Good enough to have two competitive matches against Liverpool, one against Atalanta and another against Ajax. No world beaters, but a similar profile to the teams that Celtic have failed against in this competition in previous seasons - Ferencvaros, Cluj, AEK Athens. There would have been relief that Celtic played admirably on the night and regret that they didn't build a lead to bring to Denmark next week.  On the balance of play, and the creation of chances, Ange Postecoglou's side were considerably better than the visitors.  Three moments stymied them - Nir Bitton's asinine red card, Odsonne Edouard's missed one-on-one and Vasilis Barkas' awful goalkeeping for the equaliser.  Celtic had an 18-year-old and a 21-year-old in central defence for more than half the game and they stood up well, they had a 19-year-old on the wing in Liel Abada and he was terrific.  They had Ryan Christie returning to form either because he's committed to Celtic or because he was showcasing what he's got to other clubs and they had Callum McGregor delivering a strong performance as captain.  They had lots of things, apart from a victory. Satisfying and frustrating almost in equal measure. Towards the end of his radio interview,  Postecoglou returned to a theme that he'd aired pre-match, a call for more recruits. \"We've got to help and support these players with reinforcements and it's got to happen quickly,\" he said.  Given the maxim that a rebuild of any side must begin from the back then, perhaps, the most pressing concern right now is that of the Celtic goalkeeper. They have ducked and dived between Barkas, Scott Bain and, fleetingly, Conor Hazard over the last year or so. Barkas, the £4.5m man, is in situ and he's no more convincing now than he was last season.  His hapless attempt to stop Evander's 63rd-minute free-kick was his Celtic experience in microcosm. Somebody, somewhere must have a file that suggests that Barkas was worth such a lavish fee and is capable of being a commanding presence, but he's played 23 times for the club now and there's still not a shred of evidence that he's a keeper of worth.  You'll search long and hard to find somebody who can remember him making a save of any note. He's 6ft 4in but doesn't dominate his goal, doesn't pull off the kind of stops that any ambitious team needs their goalkeeper to make, and isn't particularly convincing with the ball at his feet.  And yet he was back in the frame. When Postecoglou talked about reinforcements he must have had a goalkeeper in mind. Previously, in their trophy-laden years, Celtic had Fraser Forster, Craig Gordon and, going further back still, Arthur Boruc. All outstanding. Not many successful teams have a shaky operator between the sticks.  Rangers have Allan McGregor. That's the kind of stature required. Arguably, on what we've seen so far, there are at least four or five better goalkeepers than Barkas in Scotland right now. Once again, there's talk about Forster returning. True or not, Celtic need to nail down a new number one or they're going nowhere. The fact that Celtic went into a Champions League qualifier with Stephen Welsh and Bitton as their centre-half pairing tells you something about how slowly the recruitment wheels have been turning.  When Bitton was sent off - a disgraceful lack of professionalism given he knew how short on options Celtic were in his position - Postecoglou had the 18-year-old Dane Murray or the 21-year-old Osaze Urhoghide to pick from. It will all look different in weeks, or months to come - Christopher Jullien will return and a new partnership might be formed with Carl Starfelt, with the Swede  having signed  the day after the Midtjylland game. Still, that's in the future. In the here and now Celtic have to hang on. One of the immediate challenges for them is to survive in the Champions League for as long as it takes for a cavalry to arrive. Even with Starfelt signed, they need another centre-half on top of that. They need right-backs, a left-back, an imposing presence in the centre of midfield and another wide player. They have Kyogo Furuhashi to come in up front but they have to be lining up another striker in the event that Edouard departs. Albian Ajeti has it all to prove. Leigh Griffiths? Lord knows how that's going to go. Hence, Postecoglou's words about recruitment on Monday and again on Tuesday. They might be working hard behind the scenes at Celtic, but there's still no director of football, still no head of recruitment, still no sign of Postecoglou adding to his backroom staff. The new manager cuts an impressive figure, but he had only one new signing he felt he could trust on Tuesday. That was Abada, who relished his night until he became collateral damage in the wake of Bitton's stupidity. Postecoglou has a right to expect new players - his players - in the door in double-quick time.  At their best, Celtic showed an impressive urgency against Midtjylland. For the sake of their Champions League prospects you'd hope the board will take their lead from their manager and do the same. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57917043"},

{"title": "Manchester City 6-3 RB Leipzig: Last season's runners-up off to flying start", "content": "900 Jack Grealish scored a wonderful goal on his Champions League debut as Manchester City scored six past RB Leipzig to put the pain of losing last season's final behind them.  City produced a stunning attacking display to overcome last season's Bundesliga runners-up and get their Group A campaign off to a winning start. Grealish, the British record £100m signing from Aston Villa, illuminated Etihad Stadium after cutting inside from the left before curling home to make it 4-2. In an extraordinary game, Nathan Ake had put Pep Guardiola's side ahead with a powerful header - the 10th different player to score in a City shirt this season - before a calamitous own goal by Nordi Mukiele doubled the lead. The France defender got his angles horribly wrong as his attempted header back to his keeper following Kevin de Bruyne's delivery ended up in the net. City did not have things all their own way, however, and Mukiele made up for his error by playing a role in Christopher Nkunku's goal to make it 2-1 before Riyad Mahrez restored the two-goal cushion with a penalty after Lukas Klostermann handled. Nkunku gave RB Leipzig hope with a header only for Grealish to his score his second for the club with a delightful finish. Former Paris St-Germain player Nkunku completed his hat-trick, but Joao Cancelo added a stunning fifth and substitute Gabriel Jesus a sixth to set City up nicely for their biggest test in the group away to PSG on 28 September. RB Leipzig finished with 10 men after former Manchester City player Angelino was sent off in the 79th minute for a second yellow card. Guardiola had urged his players before the game to use the hurt from losing last season's final to spur them to go one step further this time. In an astonishing match, they scored three times in each half to take their tally to 17 in the past four matches. Nkunku's hat-trick means that Guardiola was not entirely satisfied with what he saw but there were plenty of positives as City's season continues to gather momentum. De Bruyne did not look like a player making his first start of the season after injury, as the Belgium midfielder produced an electric performance, while Grealish looked like he belonged on the Champions League stage. The England midfielder continues to thrive in his new surroundings and delivered one of the game's outstanding moments with his stunning finish. After delivering the corner for Ake to score the game's opening goal, Grealish became the first Englishman to both score and assist on their Champions League debut since Wayne Rooney in September 2004. With Phil Foden coming on to make his first appearance for City since the Champions League final defeat, Guardiola's side are looking stronger each game. Ever the perfectionist, he will not be happy with the goals his side conceded. Guardiola, in charge of City for the 300th time, was at his animated best as he delivered instructions to both Grealish and Mahrez as his side closed in on victory. There were some empty seats at the Etihad and Guardiola appealed for fans to turn out for Saturday's Premier League game with Southampton. \"We scored 16 goals in the last three games here. I'd like more people to come on Saturday. We will be tired. Southampton are so dangerous. I invite all our people to come 3pm to watch our game,\" he said.

{"title": "Celtic 1-1 Midtjylland: No winning start for Postecoglou in Champions League", "content": "Ange Postecoglou said he has not \"done a great job so far\" as his Celtic tenure began with a Champions League qualifying draw with Midtjylland that saw both sides reduced to 10 men. Impressive debutant Liel Abada gave Celtic the lead but was replaced before the break following Nir Bitton's second yellow for reacting to simulation from Anders Dreyer. The Midtjylland winger was later sent off himself after repeating the offence but Evander flashed a free-kick past Vasilis Barkas to level the tie. The return leg takes place next Wednesday in Denmark, with the winners progressing to face PSV Eindhoven or Galatasaray in the third qualifying round, and Postecoglou said his side \"will be better prepared, no doubt\". \"I don't think we will ever be as badly prepared as we were tonight and that's on me,\" he said. \"I haven't done a great job so far because with the disruptions we've had, we haven't been able to bring the players in. My role is to try and reinforce and prepare this squad. \"To their credit, the players didn't look for excuses. They put in a solid shift and I'm just disappointed they didn't get the rewards for what I thought was an outstanding performance.\" Manager Postecoglou received a warm welcome from the 9,000 crowd as Celtic played a competitive home game in front of fans for the first time in 16 months. With a depleted squad and the Australian still adjusting to his new role, Celtic needed calm heads as they attempted to edge closer to a first Champions League group-stage appearance since 2017-18. Israel's Bitton, 29, was by far the most experienced member of a makeshift backline, only to let his team-mates down when they had wrested control after a disjointed start. Bitton's countryman, 19-year-old Abada, had lit up the occasion before his lively debut on the right flank was cut short. After Odsonne Edouard sent a snap-shot narrowly over the crossbar, Ababa's two precise deliveries to Ryan Christie resulted in the Scotland midfielder stabbing a shot against a post then sending a flying header too high. Both players were again involved as the opening goal of the Postecoglou era arrived in the 39th minute. Christie's angled strike from the left was parried by goalkeeper Jonas Lossl and Abada pounced to tuck in an awkward finish. Celtic were a goal up and looking good - then Bitton had a rush of blood to the head. Dreyer tumbled under his challenge in the hope of winning a penalty, prompting the Celtic player - booked for an earlier foul - to poke a finger in the winger's face and earn a second yellow. Abada was sacrificed, with 18-year-old defender Dane Murray coming on for a debut - partnering 21-year-old Stephen Welsh at centre-back - and the complexion of the tie seemed to have altered drastically. But Dreyer was dismissed shortly after the interval for a tumble under pressure from Welsh, and captain Callum McGregor thundered a shot off the crossbar as Celtic tried to immediately capitalise. Christie's pass then superbly split the Danish side's defence, but Edouard's meek shot was blocked by goalkeeper Lossl's leg. Midtyjlland broke upfield and Brazilian midfielder Evander whistled a drive inches past.  But the hosts failed to heed the warning and the Danes, who hadn't created a clear-cut chance, were level when Evander whipped a free-kick from the left into the top corner, with goalkeeper Barkas looking suspect. Celtic seemed more likely to grab a winner, with Christie firing off target and substitute Tom Rogic having an effort saved, but the game petered out to a frustrating draw for the Scottish side. The early signs of Postecoglou's philosophy were apparent as Celtic, despite their inexperience in defence, built from the back and tried to play at a high tempo. Teenage defender Murray can be proud of his performance having been thrown in at the Champions League deep end. However, the individual calamities that blighted Celtic last season again came to the fore. Bitton's needless red card had echoes of his Old Firm derby dismissal in January, while the reinstated Barkas wasted a chance to nail down the number one spot and continues to underwhelm as a £4.5m signing. While an opening victory eluded him, Postecoglou will have seen little to worry him in Denmark. Midtjylland, who sold star midfielder Frank Onyeka to Brentford earlier in the day, are a functional team but lacking in quality.  \"I was frustrated at the result, not the performance, but Nir had already been booked and when you've been booked you have to be careful in your actions. \"It's disappointing for him more than anything, because he was really keen to put in a strong performance. \"He had started the game really well for us, so it's disappointing for him that he misses the second game as well.\" The sides go again in the second leg in Denmark on 28 July (18:45 BST), and Celtic begin their Premiership season three days later away to Hearts (20:00 BST).

{"title": "Champions League final: Kai Havertz & N'Golo Kante key for Chelsea against Man City", "content": "Every Manchester City fan I spoke to outside the ground in Porto after their defeat in the Champions League final asked me the same thing - 'why didn't he play Fernandinho?' But I can see why City boss Pep Guardiola left his captain out, and I can understand why Rodri didn't start either. Pep has thought 'I don't need a holding midfielder in the centre' because Chelsea play with two men on the outside in Mason Mount and Kai Havertz behind Timo Werner. Pep thought by going with Ilkay Gundogan in there instead, City could be more creative - but he must have known it would leave them much more open than usual. Chelsea were clever, of course. Although they kept their defensive shape extremely well, they were not passive about it - they were trying things as well.  They knew City wanted to press them high, so they pulled Havertz on to Oleksandr Zinchenko to stop him pushing on to Reece James down their right side. That worked going forward as well as defensively. Havertz was constantly playing on Zinchenko's shoulder, but the only time he ran inside him was for Chelsea's winner, when Ruben Dias was dragged away by Werner and it left that big gap down the middle. Meanwhile, James just had Raheem Sterling to look after rather than worrying about Zinchenko coming at him too, and he dealt with Sterling brilliantly. It was the same on the opposite flank, where Mount pushed on to Kyle Walker and Ben Chilwell kept Riyad Mahrez quiet. So, out wide, Chelsea were on top. When City's wingers got in one-on-one situations, they rarely got past James or Chilwell whether they went inside them or outside. Down the middle, N'Golo Kante was breaking play up so well too, pinching things and stopping City from building any momentum with their passing. Ultimately, City will be disappointed they didn't move Chelsea around more, but you have to give huge credit to Thomas Tuchel for the way he set Chelsea up. With five at the back, and two in front, there was no way through. Kante was meant to be a fitness doubt with a hamstring injury but he absolutely bossed the midfield.  I could tell there was no problem with him when he darted into City's box to get on the end of a cross in the first few minutes. You don't make runs like that if you are just trying to get through a game, and he ended up playing an integral role. City's line-up was a bold one, but Kante was one of the reasons they ended up barely registering a shot on target. Officially they had one, when Edouard Mendy blocked a Sterling flick early on, but James had already got a foot in and the chance had pretty much gone. That was the only time Mendy had to make a save - apart from that there were a couple of dangerous balls across his box, and a Mahrez shot in stoppage time that flew just over.  That was it, while Chelsea kept getting behind City, and had plenty of other opportunities before and after their goal. The lack of an attacking threat wasn't the only way this was totally different to the kind of display we have got used to seeing from City this season. Pep changed things around a few games into the campaign and basically said his side were now going to stay tight, and allow fewer counter-attacks against them.  City focused on keeping the ball and grinding teams down from there, and we have seen countless masterclasses in that from them in the past few months. This time, though, it was as if Pep thought he had to go and open the game up, because otherwise Chelsea would have just sat in. I am sure he understood the risks that went with doing that. I'd be amazed if he didn't - but for various reasons, his plan did not work. He will get some criticism now about changing a winning style because City lost, and are still waiting for their first Champions League triumph. But let's keep some perspective. City have come a long way, and this was their first Champions League final. It came in a season where they have played twice a week, every week, and have ended up with the Premier League title. Losing will hurt Pep and his players, as much as it will be an amazing experience for Chelsea. who thoroughly deserved their victory. But this has still been a great season for City - one frustrating night does not change that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57295894"},
{"title": "Thomas Tuchel's masterclass leaves Pep Guardiola in despair", "content": "Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was at pains to stress this Champions League final was about so much more than his tactical and personal battle with Manchester City's Pep Guardiola - and yet the story of this showpiece will have both cast as its central characters. Tuchel, a loser with Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich in last season's final, made no mistake with his second chance as he prepared and plotted to perfection to produce a finely tuned, intensely committed Chelsea side fully deserving  the victory that saw them crowned champions of Europe  for a second time. In contrast, Guardiola chose to select a starting 11 he had never picked before in his time as City manager, gambling on an array of attacking talent to compensate for his decision not to use either of his outstanding midfield anchors Fernandinho or Rodri. It was a move that left City riddled with confusion, lacking fluency, missing a midfield leader and reducing their attacking threat - in other words it was a selection that deprived the Premier League champions, so outstanding this season, of some of the elements that make them so special. As Tuchel celebrated with his family in front of joyous Chelsea fans gathered in Porto's Estadio Do Dragao, owner Roman Abramovich beamed from the stands at yet another example of how his club turns the game's normal rules upside down. In Chelsea's world, out of instability comes success. Managerial dismissals bring trophies, as they have done so regularly. As it has done with Tuchel winning the Champions League after replacing Frank Lampard in January, and as it did when Roberto di Matteo replaced Andre Villas-Boas in 2012 and won this tournament for the first time. Chelsea's fans had warmly embraced their German manager even before kick-off, huge cheers greeting his appearance for pre-match media duties. He waved back and prompted instant thunderous applause. And in the closing stages Chelsea's followers responded with deafening noise when Tuchel turned to them and waved his arms demanding more noise to get his players over the line on this night of glory. Chelsea had heroes everywhere, none more so than the magnificent N'Golo Kante, who delivered the complete midfield performance, this game's great manipulator and controller. When Fernandinho did finally arrive on the scene, approximately 64 minutes too late, Kante had this Champions League final by the scruff of the neck and was not letting go. Kante's performance was one of the great big match displays, breathtaking in its skill, energy and uncanny ability to be everywhere the action was - but make no mistake his life was made a lot easier by the absence of Fernandinho, even at 36, and Rodri.. Reece James has found himself dragged into the debate about England's right-back slot for the Euros and the potential exclusion of Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold but he stated his case eloquently, snuffing out the threat of a struggling Raheem Sterling to such an extent that it was no surprise when Manchester City's forward was substituted. And in match winner Kai Havertz, Chelsea have an elegant, dangerous weapon who is now flourishing after a slow start to his Stamford Bridge career. Mason Mount produced yet another mature masterclass that illustrated why he is a certain midfield starter for England in the forthcoming Euros. Ben Chilwell was another stand-out performer. It is Tuchel, however, who must take the greatest credit for restoring self-belief, confidence and organisation to Chelsea after Lampard's departure, especially by making the common sense moves of putting the combative, edgy Antonio Rudiger back into the heart of defence and putting Kante in the midfield position where he operates to such world-class game-changing effect. The champagne-soaked Tuchel was wearing a smile that looked like it might have to be surgically removed as he celebrated. And why shouldn't he celebrate? He suffered the pain of defeat in last season's Champions League final. Here in Porto, he stood among the litter of blue and silver glitter as a winner, the mastermind of a triumph that writes his name in Chelsea history. What a contrast it was to the despair of Guardiola and Manchester City, who will leave Porto accompanied by bitter disappointment and regrets after a night on which his team failed to produce the goods. Guardiola was hoping to write history of his own, putting his name alongside Bob Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane by winning this tournament for a third time as a manager. He last won it with Barcelona a decade ago and cut a despondent figure as he strolled past the giant silver trophy that remains tantalisingly out of reach for City despite all their spectacular domestic achievements. One of Guardiola's great qualities as a manager is his determination to fashion the beautiful game accompanied by attacking football - but maybe the in-built instincts got the better of him when he chose a line-up that raised eyebrows as soon as the teamsheets landed. No Rodri. No Fernandinho. No protection. Attack-minded players everywhere. Chelsea seized on City's uncertainty.  Mount and Chilwell overran City down the left and, to the naked eye, it appeared that even seasoned, experienced operators such as Kevin de Bruyne - whose final was cut short by a very heavy illegal hit from Rudiger that left him with a swollen eye - Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, seemed uncertain of what their actual roles were. Little was seen of Riyad Mahrez, outstanding this season, while Sterling simply continued to look out of sorts, a players striving for previous good form, and on this night failing to find it. Guardiola's strategy was high risk and the outcome suggests it was fatally flawed. He cannot escape scrutiny on his own part in a desperate night for City. He selected a team that had a negative impact on the smooth running of the outstanding side that won the Premier League with plenty to spare. He is one of the great coaches and managers who has shaped the way modern football is played, influenced so many other coaches, but this was a night when the old questions about over-thinking were asked again. It is hard to criticise a manager who has won the Premier League for three of the past four seasons and has such a stellar career record but he tried a line-up he had never used before in arguably the biggest game in City's history after a season of domestic domination. Rodri and Fernandinho had figured in 60 out of 61 games for City this season, either individually or as a pair. Why change the strategy so radically and use this system in a match of such huge significance? Guardiola's plan failed and he will have to accept the criticism that will inevitably come his way. Tuchel has now beaten Guardiola three times since he was appointed in January, in the FA Cup semi-final and in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium. This was, by some margin, the sweetest victory of all. This is the victory that means Tuchel has already made an indelible mark at Chelsea despite only being at the club a matter of months. For Guardiola and Manchester City, the wait goes on. The pain will be acute because they will know they are capable of so much better. Chelsea are the champions of Europe - a statement that might have been ridiculed on the day Tuchel walked through the doors of Stamford Bridge.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57296303"},
{"title": "Champions League final: N'Golo Kante comes out on top for pundits and BBC Sport readers", "content": "\"He is Claude Makelele plus extras.\" Mason Mount provided the brilliant assist, Kai Havertz got the decisive goal but pundits and BBC Sport readers were in agreement who the best Chelsea player was as they beat Manchester City to win the Champions League. N'Golo Kante was everywhere for the Blues, breaking up attacks and dictating play in the middle of the pitch and he was a significant reason why Manchester City were limited to just one shot on target. BBC Sport readers gave the 30-year-old France midfielder by the far the highest rating in the game with 8.43. \"I don't think there is a more important player for his team in world football than N'Golo Kante. He drove this team,\" former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole said on BT Sport, before going on to compare him with fellow French midfielder and former Chelsea player Claude Makelele. \"I played with Claude Makelele and I thought he was the best in that position until I saw this kid,\" said Cole. \"He is Makelele plus extras.\" N'Golo Kanté", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57294923"},
{"title": "Champions League final: Did Manchester City's Pep Guardiola tinker too much against Chelsea?", "content": "1425 Pep Guardiola was in a pragmatic mood following Manchester City's Champions League final defeat to Chelsea, but was it one tinker too many by the City boss? Having seen his side sweep aside many challengers both in Europe and on their way to the Premier League title, Guardiola sprung a surprise with his team selection in Porto. He left out captain Fernandinho and fellow holding midfielder Rodri from his starting line-up and instead chose to play the more attack-minded Bernardo Silva alongside Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan. The outcome was that City never really managed to get a grip on midfield throughout the game, their defence was exposed while their attack was also hampered as they finished the game on the  wrong end of 1-0 defeat  having managed just a single shot on target in 97 minutes. Guardiola has been known to adjust his team selection to try and outfox his opponents. Asked why he made the changes he did for this game, he replied: \"I did the best in the selection.  \"Against Lyon [in 2020] like it was against PSG, Dortmund, I tried the selection the best to win the game. The players know it, I think Ilkay Gundogan played good, we were exceptional.\" But was it the wrong decision? Or did Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel simply have the measure of him? \"I think [tinkering too much] will be levelled at him because he changed the way he had played all season,\" former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport. \"He has always had Rodri or Fernandinho in there but he changed it. We know tactically he tinkers, he might have seen a weakness in there but Thomas Tuchel nullified any threat. \"We saw Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling played really wide, they've not really done that this season and maybe that is something City did wrong.\" Former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton felt City players should also shoulder some of the blame for failing to put in a performance. \"Where do Manchester City go from here? This was the one Pep Guardiola wanted to win, they did not turn up on the night,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"A team as talented as City, they did not work Edouard Mendy enough tonight and that will be of real frustration for them.\" However, Sutton had said prior to kick-off that not starting Fernandinho would prove to be a mistake. \"You need your leaders and Fernandinho is that,\" he said. \"Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira were enforcers and he can drag their team up, you want him standing next to you in the trenches.\" For ex-Everton and West Ham midfielder Don Hutchison, the defeat highlighted just how much Manchester City need an out-and-out striker for next season. \"Pep will take a lot of criticism and I am a big fan,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"I don't consider this a failure - yes, it is the big one but I hope he doesn't come under too much criticism. \"This might sharpen Pep's mind and he might say if I am going to win the Champions League, I need 30 goals a season, I need Harry Kane.\" To put it down to Guardiola just getting it wrong would also downplay the fact that Tuchel has not just got the better of the City boss once this season, or even twice, but three times. Tuchel took charge of Chelsea in January but in that time he has overseen victories against Guardiola's side in the FA Cup, Premier League and now the Champions League. \"To do what he has done coming halfway through the season is nothing short of a magician,\" Ferdinand added. \"He has come into this country and played Pep Guardiola's side three times this season and won all three.\" More often than not, football is an unexpected game, perhaps Pep thought it was too much about him this evening. This is why we all love it so much, and it's only going to get better with the Euros in June! As a Bayern fan, I felt Guardiola was great for tactical excellence and discipline across the season. But something was missing in the top, top moments in Europe. It feels the same today.  Pep is a genius but he got it wrong tonight, had to start with Aguero. Toothless up front. Those half-chances would have been converted by Aguero. Commiserations.  People need to start respecting Tuchel a lot more. Tactically spot on against Man City three times now! The impact he has had since coming in has been insane!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57296822"},

The incident took place as the French side beat Sparta Prague 2-0 in the first leg of the Champions League third qualifying round in the Czech capital. Tchouameni, 21, posted on Twitter that the \"hateful messages\" will not affect him personally. \"I won't let hate win this game,\" the midfielder said. France Under-21 player Tchouameni scored the opener for the Ligue 1 side with a header in the 37th minute before German striker Kevin Volland doubled their advantage in the second half.  Following Tchouameni's goal, he and his team-mates ran over to Monaco manager Niko Kovac and Uefa officials - including English referee Michael Oliver - to complain about alleged racist chanting from the crowd directed towards him.  The match was held up for three minutes as Uefa protocols were followed by Oliver.   A message played on the public address system and posted on the Letna Stadium screen warned that further racist abuse would lead to the game being stopped. Tchouameni questioned the procedures Uefa have in place to deal with racist behaviour, asking why players who are racially abused are not involved in deciding the protocols.  He also queried why a game could be stopped to check if a player was offside \"by an inch\" but the same could not be done for racist chanting from the stands.  \"Yesterday, our club cam was on the pitch and caught it all,\" he added. \"It was loud and clear.\"  Kovac said after the game Monaco were \"very sad and disgusted\" that abuse of this nature still continues \"in the 21st century\".

{"title": "Champions League 2021-22 preview - Guardiola, Klopp, Tuchel & Solskjaer eye big prize", "content": "The group stage of what promises to be a fascinating Champions League season gets under way this week. Holders Chelsea are part of an English quartet in the mix, along with last season's runners-up Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United. Intriguingly, the latter will have the competition's record goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo in their side. And for the first time, Lionel Messi will play for someone other than Barcelona in the tournament. His new club Paris St-Germain will begin as one of the favourites following a summer that has seen them recruit a number of seasoned Champions League campaigners. But who else will be aiming for glory in St Petersburg in May? Which other players should you look out for? And can we expect another English winner this season? BBC Sport tries to provide the answers. Three-and-a-half months ago,  Kai Havertz's goal gave Chelsea victory  over Manchester City in the 2020-21 Champions League final in Portugal's Estadio do Dragao. Ominously, the Blues appear even stronger going into this year's tournament, having recruited striker Romelu Lukaku, a scorer of 13 goals in 27 Champions League matches and more than 300 in his club career, and midfielder Saul Niguez, a  runner-up in Europe's premier club competition with Atletico Madrid in 2016. Drawn in a group with Juventus, Zenit St Petersburg and Malmo, Chelsea have been given a 92% chance of reaching the knockout rounds by data experts Nielsen Gracenote, which is second best behind Real Madrid. Manchester City are not far behind on 89%, although they face a tough task in Group A, which also includes a star-studded PSG, RB Leipzig and Bruges. Pep Guardiola has strengthened with the British-record £100m signing of Jack Grealish, but has lost Sergio Aguero - a man with 78 games and 41 goals in the Champions League to his name. Liverpool continue to rely on the core of players that led them to Champions League glory in 2019 and face arguably the toughest group of all the English sides, being drawn against Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, Portuguese Primeira Liga runners-up Porto and Italy's seven-time European champions AC Milan. It was this draw that led to a drop of 10% in their chances of reaching the knockout rounds according to Nielsen Gracenote, to 75% - the lowest of the four English sides. And then there are Manchester United, looking to at least avoid a group-stage exit for a second successive season. The Red Devils have arguably the easiest pathway to the knockout rounds of all four Premier League sides, although Group F does pit them against the side that beat them on penalties in last season's Europa League final, Villarreal. They now have in their arsenal arguably the Champions League's most potent weapon in Ronaldo, who holds the record for most goals in the competition (135) and most assists (42) and has five winners' medals, his first coming in 2008 - the last time United won the tournament. Ronaldo's move to Old Trafford also sets up an intriguing continuation of his personal battle for records and honours with Messi. Messi's move from Barcelona to the French capital was the transfer story of the summer and his arrival will give PSG hope of finally claiming Europe's top prize. The 34-year-old Argentine, who has 120 Champions League goals in 149 games as part of a career that has seen him find the net close to 700 times, is not the only notable recruit by the French club. Centre-back Sergio Ramos brings four winners' medals and 129 Champions League appearances with him from Real Madrid, Georginio Wijnaldum has won it with Liverpool, Gianluigi Donnarumma has just been named player of Euro 2020 with Italy (more on that in a bit) and Achraf Hakimi is one of the highest-rated full-backs in the world. Boss Mauricio Pochettino, himself a Champions League runner-up with Tottenham, also has Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Angel di Maria, Marco Verratti and more at his disposal. It has certainly been a tough summer for Barcelona, who lost talisman Messi amid a perilous financial situation that meant they could only register new signings such as Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia after defender Gerard Pique agreed to a wage cut to comply with salary cap rules. They still have talent in the ranks, not least in young midfielder Pedri, and should be competitive, as suggested by Gracenote giving them an 85% chance of getting out of Group E. But German champions Bayern Munich, Benfica and Dinamo Kiev won't give them an easy ride. Real Madrid also have financial worries, but they have not been as costly to them this summer as their El Clasico rival, although Ramos is clearly a loss. They have recruited well in two-time Champions League winner David Alaba from Bayern Munich and highly rated France midfielder Eduardo Camavinga from Rennes and will hope to wring every last drop out of Luka Modric, Karim Benzema and maybe even Gareth Bale. Gracenote gives them a competition-high of 93% to qualify from a group also containing a weakened Inter Milan, Shakhtar Donetsk and Sheriff Tiraspol. There are seemingly few concerns for Atletico Madrid right now. The Spanish champions are in theory stronger this season than last, with Antoine Griezmann returning to the club from Barcelona along with the signing of talented South American duo Rodrigo de Paul and Matheus Cunha. As mentioned earlier, their group is a tricky one, though. Spain's other entrant, Sevilla, could be one to watch. A group featuring Lille, Red Bull Salzburg and Wolfsburg looks winnable and they were competitive last season in reaching the last 16. As they have in the past, Bayern Munich's solution to renewing themselves has been to plunder their nearest rival. Borussia Dortmund have been victims before, but this time it is RB Leipzig who have lost their manager Julian Nagelsmann, captain Marcel Sabitzer and top defender Dayot Upamecano to Bayern. They should certainly improve the German champions, having helped Leipzig to the last 16 and semi-finals of the Champions League in recent seasons. As for Leipzig, they suffered most from the draw, according to Gracenote, with their chances of reaching the knockout phase reduced by 17% after pulling out both PSG and Manchester City. Dortmund have lost Jadon Sancho but kept Erling Braut Haaland, and it feels as if Group C - also containing Portuguese champions Sporting Lisbon, Dutch champions Ajax and Turkish side Besiktas - is completely up for grabs. What a summer it was for Italian sport, with their Euros win at Wembley testament to their talent and tactical nous. Roberto Mancini's side are now 37 matches unbeaten -  the longest such run in international football.  But will this translate into club success in the Champions League? Inter Milan were the top Italian side last season, and have Euro 2020 star Nicolo Barella in their ranks, but they look significantly weaker having lost Hakimi and Lukaku.  Juventus have brought in midfielder Manuel Locatelli, who impressed in the summer tournament, but will undoubtedly suffer for the loss of Ronaldo, top scorer in Serie A last season. Atalanta are talented but lack pedigree in the competition, while AC Milan have the pedigree but maybe not the talent, especially with Euro 2020 goalkeeping hero Donnarumma no longer at the club.

The Champions League is back and, on a dramatic night across Europe, the competition delivered a reminder of why it can produce memorable, must-watch football. While Tuesday's action failed to get pulses significantly racing, Wednesday produced 28 goals as well as myriad stories and sub-plots. Liverpool played out a  thriller with Milan, Manchester City hit six,  an  ex-West Ham striker set the evening alight  and  Lionel Messi underwhelmed  - and that was just the start of it. It was a matchday that had managers, players and pundits confused and delighted. Liverpool and AC Milan don't seem able to do normal games of football when they meet. Thankfully. Having between them produced arguably the greatest European Cup final of all time in 2005, when the Reds came back from 3-0 down to win the trophy on penalties, they then gave us Milan's revenge in another gripping tournament-deciding showdown two years later.

It is deserved but we had 10 minutes where Milan nearly changed the whole tie.\" Defender Andy Robertson added: \"First half an hour we blew them away. Then we got sloppy and stopped doing the things we were doing really well.  \"We let them back into the game and walked in at half-time thinking 'how have we let this happen?' \"We need to be smarter. Really tough but we managed to come out second half, play our football and enjoy it again.\" Pep Guardiola is not going to forget his 300th match in charge of Manchester City in a hurry. One hundred and nine days after their painful night in Porto, when they lost a final to Chelsea they were expected to win, they came roaring out of the blocks to get their Group A campaign off to a flying start against RB Leipzig. Six goals, six different scorers. New £100m man Jack Grealish scored an absolute classic as he became the first Englishman to both score and assist on their Champions League debut since Wayne Rooney in September 2004. \"The players are always talking about last season's final. They're determined to go one better this year,\" said Grealish, whose goal put City 4-2 ahead. \"It's a good start for us. Hopefully we can go all the way this time.\" In an incident-packed game, Leipzig finished with 10-men after former Manchester City player Angelino was sent off for two bookable offences. \"What a great performance, particularly going forward, what a fabulous attacking performance,\" former England midfielder Owen Hargreaves told BT Sport. With Nathan Ake opening the scoring, 10 different players have scored in a City shirt in the past four games. In addition, they have now rattled in 16 goals in the past three home matches. Boss Pep Guardiola then urged the support of his club's fans for Saturday's visit of Southampton in the Premier League after the rigours of their Champions League opener. \"I'd like more people to come on Saturday,\" he said. \"We will be tired. Southampton are so dangerous. I invite all our people to come at 3pm to watch our game.\" For all the hype it turned out to be a disappointing first start in a Paris St-Germain shirt for Lionel Messi. The Argentine, on his 150th Champions League appearance and first in the competition for any side other than Barcelona, struck the crossbar but was frustrated along with his team-mates by a well-drilled Club Bruges, whose spending and resources pale in comparison to their star-studded opponents. Ander Herrera opened the scoring for PSG but the Belgian side more than deserved Hans Vanaken's equaliser as they went on to draw 1-1.  Kylian Mbappe set up the opener before heading off injured after 51 minutes while Messi was booked and both he and Neymar were well dealt with by the hosts. \"Nobody in the team can be happy with their performance and nobody can be happy with this result,\" said PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino.  \"We came here to take points. All the points. Hats off to Club Bruges. They wanted it more than us tonight and they deserve the point.\" BT Sport pundit Hargreaves added: \"PSG were probably one of the favourites going into this competition with the summer they had. Pochettino will be trying to get the balance right with so many top players.\" Sebastien Haller was left out of Ajax's Europa League squad last year because of a club administrative error and he showed the Dutch outfit just what they missed with one of the most spectacular Champions League debuts. The former West Ham striker became the second player in the history of the competition to score four goals on his debut in Ajax's 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon. He is the first player to achieve that feat since Marco van Basten for AC Milan against IFK Gothenburg in November 1992 - although the Dutch player had previously featured in the European Cup. \"I just tried to be not too emotional because being so young and playing these kind of games it's a dream,\" said the 27-year-old. \"I was just focused on doing my job, focusing on the other team, tactically, physically and today I thank my team-mates for all this.\" Oh. And that was not all. Sheriff Tiraspol became Moldova's first Champions League representatives as they beat Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0. That makes them the first team since Leicester City in 2016 to win on their Champions League debut. Jude Bellingham (18 years, 78 days) became the youngest player to score in consecutive Champions League games, surpassing Mbappe. He scored and assisted one as  Borussia Dortmund beat Bestikas 2-1. Erling Braut Haaland, who scored the second, has netted 21 goals in 17 Champions League games - 10 matches quicker than anybody else has managed. Two youngsters teamed up in the 89th minute as  Real Madrid won at the San Siro  against Serie A champions Inter Milan. Eduardo Camavinga set up Rodrygo for the only goal. And Atletico Madrid drew 0-0 with Porto. We don't have anything to get excited about with that one.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58579179"},

They are competitors who want to win and help the team achieve good.\" PSG host Manchester City  in the Champions League on Tuesday. Brazil's Neymar, 29, and France's Mbappe, 22, have linked up well together for PSG since joining in the summer of 2017 - for the two biggest transfer fees of all time. Mbappe has scored 136 goals in 180 games for PSG, with Neymar - who has had frequent injury problems - hitting 88 in 121. \"I have spoken to them individually,\" he said. \"They may have also spoken to each other and there have been photos of them enjoying ourselves in training.  \"If there is a small incident sometimes that can create a wave but it is actually just talk.\" Meanwhile, Pochettino says it will take time for Neymar, Mbappe and new signing Lionel Messi to click. Messi, who played with Neymar at Barcelona, has failed to score in three games since joining on a free transfer. \"Of course they need time to work together,\" said Pochettino. \"I think they need time to work in different environments and to link up in a different way than they did in the past, when they met in different clubs.  \"Of course they are all different and may need time to get to know each other and start to play naturally because, of course, PSG is always under pressure.\" Pochettino says his fellow Argentine Messi will need time to adapt to France. The 34-year-old is playing for a club other than Barcelona for the first time in his professional career. \"We are talking about the best player in the world,\" said Pochettino.  \"You need to understand that he is a man like us that needs to adapt to the new club, the family needs to adapt to the new society and new culture.  \"Let people work, let the player adapt and start to feel at home. He was at Barcelona for 20 years. It is normal that he feels at home in Barcelona.  \"Now everything is new. He arrived not too long ago.

{"title": "PSG v Man City: Will Lionel Messi break goal drought against Pep Guardiola's side?", "content": "548 It was one of the most successful player-manager relationships of the modern era. Pep Guardiola and Lionel Messi won 14 trophies together at Barcelona during a four-year period and the pair have been dominant forces in European football for more than a decade.  Since parting ways when Guardiola left the Catalan club in 2012, no player has scored more goals against his teams in the Champions League than Messi. Their longstanding relationship and Messi's enduring brilliance helps explain why Guardiola tried to sign Messi in the summer. The Argentine instead ended up at Paris St-Germain and will face his former manager in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST). \"It was a surprise for everyone but what happened happened. Everyone now accepts it,\" Guardiola said in the build-up to the game. \"A long time ago you couldn't imagine it but it happened. In life itself you never know what happens. What is important is he'll be happy in Paris. \"Messi speaks for himself, I don't have to describe him. What he's done is more than exceptional and hopefully tomorrow he can play for the benefit of the game.\" Barcelona's current struggles under Ronald Koeman are a long way from the glory years under the Catalan side's previous coaches, most notably Guardiola and his fruitful link-up with Messi. Guardiola was promoted from boss of Barca's B team into the top job for the first team at the start of the 2008-09 season and the campaign was an unprecedented success, resulting in a Treble of trophies. Messi scored 38 goals that term and he netted a total of 211 goals under Guardiola, including an incredible 73 in just 60 matches in 2011-12, the Spaniard's final season in charge. Together the pair lifted three La Ligas, two Champions League titles - beating Manchester United in both finals - two Copas del Rey, as well as three Spanish Super Cups and two each of the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup. \"Pep immediately transmitted an enormous amount of pride in our work, ambition and hunger,\"  Messi said. \"He won our confidence from the first day because we could see that things were being done correctly and then, when results started to flow, the confidence grew with them.\" The two have crossed paths since going their separate ways and will meet again on Tuesday in the group stage of the Champions League in Paris. In the past, six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi has shown no mercy. The Argentine has scored six goals in four Champions League games against teams managed by Guardiola - the most of any player in the competition against the current City boss. In May 2015,  Messi scored twice in the semi-final first leg and eventually helped Barca reach another Champions League final with victory over Bayern Munich, who were then managed by Guardiola. \"Messi is just incredible, really strong, really fast, back to his best just as when I used to train him,\" Guardiola said. \"He is the best player of all time. I can compare him with Pele. \"I am very proud of the years we spent together.\" Messi won the last of his four Champions League titles that year, while Guardiola has never won the competition without him, coming close last season when his City side were beaten in the final by Chelsea. They last faced each other in the 2016 group stages when Messi ruthlessly despatched a hat-trick in a 4-0 thrashing at the Nou Camp and scored in a 3-1 loss at the Etihad. The unthinkable happened in the summer. Unable to meet La Liga's financial fair play rules, Barcelona could not renew Messi's contract and he left the Nou Camp. He had been linked with a reunion with Guardiola at City but instead he joined Mauricio Pochettino's PSG on a free transfer to form a formidable frontline alongside France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe and Brazil superstar Neymar. By the end of a remarkable transfer window, old foe Cristiano Ronaldo had also left Juventus to return to Manchester United and the Portuguese has already scored four times for the Premier League club. It has been a frustrating start to life in the French capital for 34-year-old Messi, with fitness issues and injury meaning he has featured in just three games - completing the full 90 minutes only once - and is yet to find the net. He appeared as a substitute for 25 minutes of his debut at Reims on 25 August and the side were held to a surprise 1-1 draw at Club Bruges in their opening Champions League group game on 15 September. Controversy followed four days later when Messi's number went up on the substitution board as he was taken off on 76 minutes by Pochettino, with players on the bench appearing to question the decision. \"He hit the bar twice against Bruges and against Lyon. Five centimetres below and he would have scored two amazing goals,\" French football expert Julien Laurens said on BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast. \"Unlike Cristiano, going back to a club and place he knew, Messi - we all knew - it would take some time. It would not be perfect straight away - that front three was not going to click straight away and there was already quite a bit of work in behind for Pochettino as well. \"There are lots of questions, Messi is still part of that process. He cared that he was subbed off. It is hard to say that he hasn't reached the expectations we had because he did some amazing things. But I think it will come.\" Italian football expert James Horncastle added: \"Man City is perfect for the first goal. Maybe that is destiny against Pep, against Man City.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58707011"},
{"title": "Club Bruges 1-1 Paris St-Germain: Lionel Messi kept quiet on first start", "content": "Lionel Messi's main task at Paris St-Germain will be to help deliver an elusive Champions League, but for all the fanfare surrounding the Argentina star's first start it proved a frustrating evening as the club began their European campaign with a draw at Club Bruges. Messi struck the crossbar but struggled to make a serious impact on his full debut and it was instead Ander Herrera who netted the opener after great work down the left from Kylian Mbappe. Hans Vanaken scored a deserved equaliser before the break to get the 29,000-seater Jan Breydel Stadium rocking. Messi was carded for a second-half foul and Mbappe replaced after 51 minutes as PSG found it difficult to break down the energetic hosts, who may feel they could have won the game themselves. PSG struggled to deal with the home side's aggressive pressing throughout and needed goalkeeper Keylor Navas to tip Charles de Ketelaere's well-struck effort over the crossbar to keep them level. Messi began to find more space as the Belgian side tired late on but the 34-year-old was unable to unpick the Bruges defence, leaving boss Mauricio Pochettino to ponder how to get the best out of his all-star front three. \"We need time to work for them to build an understanding,\" said Pochettino. \"That's been clear and we've said that in recent days. We still have to create a team.\" This was Messi's 150th appearance in the competition and, for a player so synonymous with Barcelona, it felt surreal seeing him line-up for the first time in Europe in the white away strip of PSG. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner arrives in Paris to complete a lavishly-assembled forward line including Neymar and Mbappe that will be expected to bring much-desired European success to the French capital.  Things started smoothly as Mbappe teed up Herrera for his first Champions League goal - though it was his fourth of the season in all competitions for PSG - before the blockbuster cast was split up when the French forward had to be replaced early in the second half. PSG fans have so far had to watch their new number 30 from afar, with Messi's only previous appearance since signing for the club coming as a substitute away at Reims in Ligue 1. Coincidentally, 30 was the number donned by Messi when he was handed his Champions League debut for Barcelona by Frank Rijkaard as a shaggy-haired 17-year-old in December 2004, a game that saw the already-qualified visitors lose 2-0 at Shakhtar Donetsk. Seventeen glittering years later - and though the legs may not be as fresh - the diminutive 34-year-old boasts the same crispness of thought and magnetic touch that led Ronaldinho - once a PSG star himself - to declare Messi his heir at the Camp Nou. The 'Little Flea' has since collected four European titles, 10 La Ligas and most recently a Copa America to go with his individual accolades, but that did not make life any easier for Messi and PSG in their opening Group A match against Bruges. Messi first burst into life on the edge of the Bruges area after 22 minutes, jinking into space and sliding a pass through to Mbappe, who saw his effort palmed away, and soon after the Argentine came within inches of his first PSG goal after curling an effort against the crossbar. But those moments of customary magic came either side of a deserved leveller for the hosts, with captain Vanaken arriving late to steer in Eduard Sobol's cross. No player has netted more Champions League goals for one club than Messi's 120 for Barcelona and with 20 minutes remaining he went close to opening his account for Paris St-Germain when he tested goalkeeper Simon Mignolet with a left-footed strike. Messi picked up a booking for a mistimed tackle, and he and Neymar, who last won the Champions League together in 2015, were well dealt with by the Belgian champions' backline, with Scotland defender Jack Hendry putting in a particularly impressive performance. The final whistle was met by roars from the home crowd, who continued to celebrate as Oasis tracks were belted out over the stadium tannoy on a memorable night for the club.

{"title": "Cristiano Ronaldo: Man Utd match-winner brings reminder of glory days", "content": "The celebrations started in the 95th minute and continued for almost an hour after the full-time whistle. Manchester United needed some cheer, and they got it as Wednesday's Champions League match against Villarreal was won five minutes into stoppage time. \"Viva Ronaldo\" filled the air on a night reminiscent of the glory days - for both United and their match-winner. Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys playing in the Champions League. He provided further proof by delivering another unforgettable moment in the competition. The Portuguese superstar has scored many great and important goals in European competition. Here was one that brought United's delighted supporters to their feet. Those present for the first Champions League match in front of a crowd at Old Trafford for two and a half years had been treated to a storming finish. United were disappointing overall against Villarreal and were heading for a third straight game without victory until Ronaldo stroked in from Jesse Lingard's lay-off. Despair turned to joy in a flash as Ronaldo rippled the net before running off to the corner, ripping off his shirt and throwing it into the air in celebration. \"That is what happens at Old Trafford,\" manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport. \"It has happened so many times before. We had to throw caution to the wind and we got lucky in the end. \"Sometimes it is not about 'pass there, pass there', it is the crowd - and they have sucked it in before - and when you have Cristiano on the pitch, you always have a chance. He is so good in front of goal and he has an impact on everyone.\" Ronaldo returned to United in August after 12 years away, having at one stage looked close to joining rivals Manchester City. It is believed that he spoke to Sir Alex Ferguson, his former United manager, before deciding to come back to Old Trafford. The 36-year-old has a rich history in the Champions League, having lifted the trophy five times. Against Villarreal, he made a record 178th appearance in the competition. United needed his inspiration on Wednesday. Solskjaer was under pressure after a humiliating loss in the opening group game against Young Boys. His side came into the contest following back-to-back home defeats in limp displays against West Ham and Aston Villa. But match-winner Ronaldo stood up with his fifth goal of the campaign in the renowned 'Fergie Time', bringing a beaming smile to the face of his old boss Ferguson, who enthusiastically applauded the winner. It also brought much relief to Solskjaer and supporters in the stands, who stayed inside the stadium long after full-time with that continuous rendition of \"Viva Ronaldo\". \"That's some atmosphere. I'm just soaking it in,\" former Premier League striker Clinton Morrison said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"When your team needs you, Cristiano Ronaldo produces. Credit to Manchester United - they didn't play that well, but well done to Ronaldo. \"He can have a quiet night, but that's what world-class players do - they finish like that.\" Solskjaer added: \"He has done that so many times. That is what he has done throughout his career. \"He is so strong mentally, he stays in the game and I have seen him all day today, how focused he has been. \"When he gets that one chance, it is a goal. A true mark of a very good finisher is keeping calm when the chance arrives.\" United should have lost the game. It was only scoreless at the break because of Villarreal's poor finishing and the brilliance of David de Gea in the home goal. But the visitors did take the lead in the second half when Paco Alcacer slid in to score from close range. Solskjaer had the talent to cause Villarreal problems - Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho and Paul Pogba all started - but the manager needs to figure out how best to make them effective together. He did see a moment of genius from Alex Telles, whose fabulous volley was a reminder of a much-repeated goal Paul Scholes scored in a Premier League game at Bradford 21 years ago. But the match looked to be heading for a draw until Ronaldo struck in the 95th minute. Ronaldo's 2008 Champions League winning team-mate Owen Hargreaves said on BT Sport: \"For Solskjaer, you can see the emotion on his face. This stadium went nuts and that's what Ronaldo gives you. \"He gives you hope because he can score these big goals. You don't take Ronaldo off because that's what he can do. The stadium got up for them and their big players got them over the line.\" Ex-striker Michael Owen added: \"I think United rely a bit too much on individual brilliance and moments, like the goal from Alex Telles, one of the great goals Old Trafford has seen in the last few years \"But, in the last 10 minutes, it felt more like a team, they were much better. And when you've got Ronaldo, you're always in with a chance of something happening.\" United have a testing schedule coming up - before the end of November, they face Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in the Premier League, as well as two Champions League meetings with Atalanta and the return match against Villarreal. It will be no easy spell for the manager. Solskjaer's reign seems to teeter between delight and despair. Should his side continue to struggle as a unit, the Norwegian will need further moments of individual brilliance from his star players.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58743650"},
{"title": "Bruges v Man City: Why Charles de Ketelaere looks set to become Belgium's next superstar", "content": "Charles de Ketelaere has been billed as the heir to Kevin de Bruyne's throne by Belgium football fans for the past few seasons. It was hugely symbolic then, that it was De Bruyne who provided the assist for De Ketelaere's first goal for Belgium last Sunday in the Nations League third place play-off against Italy. The Manchester City playmaker sent a majestic trademark through ball to the 20-year-old who placed his shot between Gianluigi Donnarumma's legs.  It was only a consolation as the  Red Devils lost 2-1  but, as De Ketelaere and De Bruyne embraced, it felt like a coming-of-age moment for a player expected to be Belgium's next superstar. 'King Charles', as he is already known in his homeland, will go head-to-head with De Bruyne on Tuesday night when Club Bruges entertain City in Group A, but why is he rated so highly - and how good could he be? De Ketelaere burst onto the Belgian football scene in style just two years ago, making his first two appearances - bar a Belgian Cup match - for his boyhood club in Champions League losses to Paris St-Germain. 'Prince Charles', as he was called then, was quickly upgraded to 'King' as he scored a dramatic injury-time winner at Zenit St Petersburg a year later - a goal which saw his name written in graffiti on a wall near his home and just 500m from Bruges' Jan Breydel stadium. The new hero of Belgian football is a local boy, with posters of former Club Bruges players on the walls of his bedroom.  He joined their academy at seven, used to be a ball boy, and chose football over tennis even though he had success on the court in winning regional youth tournaments.  Initially, De Ketelaere wasn't considered a top talent, mainly because numerous growth spurts led to injury problems and prevented him from getting any continuity.  Since he reached 6ft 3in though, the progress has been meteoric and, by the age of 18, he was pitting his wits - and coming out on top - against some of Europe's best players. By 2020, he was becoming the darling of the entire country. Elegant, inventive and supremely technically skilled for such a tall player, De Ketelaere caught fans' imagination as he became known for scoring dramatic goals.  He netted twice against Zenit last season and almost did it again when they needed to beat Lazio away on the last matchday in order to qualify for the Champions League last 16 - only to see his phenomenal strike from a tight angle hit the bar of Pepe Reina's goal. Shortly afterwards, he became the fifth footballer in history to win Belgium's 'Talent of the Year' award - established in 1998 for promising young sportspeople and following in the footsteps of Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku, Liverpool's Divock Origi and four-time tennis grand-slam winner Kim Clijsters. Success hasn't changed his personality though. The prodigy still lives with his mother and wants to lead a normal life, shy enough to have stopped going to the local bakery because he was asked to take selfies there. Interests include watching darts and studying law - De Ketelaere had to quit university when his career became too demanding. \"Charles doesn't want to be famous - he is a simple guy. He is never nervous, makes things look easy on the pitch, and could even look too phlegmatic at times,\" De Krant van West-Vlaanderen journalist Frans Buyse tells BBC Sport. With 98 professional appearances, two Belgian top-flight titles and a Super Cup already under his belt, his impact this season is no surprise to those who have been following his career closely, despite playing out of position as a central striker. He has already scored four goals and provided three assists in 11 league games this campaign - and played a starring role in the 1-1 Champions League draw with PSG last month, with Lionel Messi making his European debut for the visitors. Buyse added: \"Charles' best position is number 10, but experienced star Hans Vanaken plays there, so he had been moved around, used in attack, on the wing and even at left-back. \"Lately, he started to enjoy life in the penalty area, but his biggest strength is to have a lot of the ball in central midfield. \"De Ketelaere's style is reminiscent of De Bruyne. He is intelligent, and possesses great vision and a superb passing range. His dribbling is similar to De Bruyne's too. Eventually, he should take his place for Belgium.\" Veteran Club Bruges supporter Henk Vanhee told BBC Sport: \"We are extremely proud of Charles. For years we have been waiting for the club to produce a talent like De Bruyne, Lukaku or Eden Hazard - and we are certain that De Ketelaere has the quality to deliver.  \"His technical qualities are stunning, his clever touches accelerate the play. He is going to reach the top.\" Belgian journalist Sven Claes added: \"De Bruyne and De Ketelaere clearly have a great connection and were looking for each other against Italy. It seemed as if De Bruyne was taking on a father role. We will have a lot of fun with them. That goal was just the beginning. Class meets class.\"  And yet, in the Champions League on Tuesday they will be rivals.  Club Bruges' current campaign started with the draw against PSG as De Ketelaere outshone Messi and Kylian Mbappe and was the best player on the pitch. He then provided an assist and was involved in another goal when the Belgian champions sensationally won 2-1 at Leipzig. All that means they are ahead of Pep Guardiola's side before facing them twice. 'King Charles' is about to welcome De Bruyne to his castle on Tuesday - and he is more than capable of causing problems for the Premier League champions.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58916176"},

Barca - also beaten 3-0 by Bayern Munich earlier this month - have lost their opening two matches in the competition for the first time, and sit bottom of Group E.  Benfica got off to an energetic start and opened the scoring inside three minutes, when Darwin Nunez cut inside and finished low into the near corner. Rafa Silva then clipped in a second after the break and Nunez netted a penalty in a comfortable victory for the home side.  \"I'm not going to argue about the level of my team,\" said Koeman, part of the Barca side that won the European Cup in 1992. \"There's no point in comparing this with Barcelona teams of years gone by. That's as clear as water. I can only give you my opinion of my work at the club - I feel backed by my players and their attitude.\" As well as his two goals, Nunez also hit the post from out wide after rounding stranded Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who made a rash decision to charge out of his area. Luuk de Jong missed a glorious chance to level for the visitors early in the first half when presented with a seemingly open goal. But Barca only registered one effort on target and had Eric Garcia sent off for a second booking with three minutes remaining.  \"Benfica were strong physically and they're quick. I think that for the first and second goals we just had to defend much better,\" added Koeman. \"We had really good scoring chances and that's how you change the direction of a match. The fact that Benfica put away the large majority of the few chances they actually created then that's the big difference between the two teams.\" Koeman finds himself in charge of one of Europe's most successful clubs during one of their toughest spells in recent history. The club's financial struggles, emphasised by the loss of Lionel Messi to Paris St-Germain, mean this side is a long way from the one that last lifted Europe's most-sought after club prize in 2015. The five-time winners face the prospect of not featuring in the Champions League knockout stage for the first time since the 2003-04 season, when they did not qualify for competition. The last time they failed to progress from the first group stage when competing was in 2000-01, which is also when they last suffered successive group defeats, to Besiktas and AC Milan. Defeats by Bayern and Benfica in Group E this year mean Barca have lost their opening two matches in a European campaign for the first time since the 1972-73 Uefa Cup, when they were beaten in both legs by Porto. They have also conceded six goals without scoring in the process and only one team has ever progressed with a record as bad - that was Lyon, who reached the last 16 in 2007-08. Koeman has overseen eight group games as Barcelona boss but only Louis van Gaal, with five defeats in 32 games, has lost more than the Dutchman's three group-stage fixtures. In fact, Barcelona have lost four of their past five Champions League matches, drawing the other, which is as many as they lost in their previous 39. They next host Dynamo Kyiv, who sit one point above them after an opening draw with Benfica, with Koeman knowing anything but a win is likely to spell the end of his side's European hopes and potentially his time in charge.

But, inevitably, it was Ronaldo who won the game, just as he did three weeks previously against Villarreal. This time it was with one of his trademark headers as he rose to meet Luke Shaw's cross and find the bottom corner to send United to the top of Group F. This was another one of those nights when Solskjaer seemed to pull it out of the bag just as his Old Trafford reign was about to be seriously called into question. However, the home fans at least made their feelings known before kick-off with a long rendition of 'Ole's at the wheel', before the familiar 'Ole, Ole, Ole' chant rang round Old Trafford. Once the game had started, 'Who put the ball in the German net' was heard. That song is in honour of Solskjaer's most famous goal, the Champions League winner in 1999 that ensures he will always be a hero at the club, no matter how his managerial reign works out. The problem for Solskjaer is that the managing bit has not been going well at all. Brave enough to drop Paul Pogba following Saturday's defeat at Leicester, when the United boss bemoaned his side's defending at set-pieces and said something had to change, Solskjaer was rewarded by one of the Frenchman's midfield replacements going missing for the Atalanta opener before his side conceded a second at a corner. From a position of limited danger, United were suddenly in loads of it, purely because Davide Zappacosta's overlapping run went completely unchecked as Scott McTominay failed to react. The low cross invited the finish, which Pasalic duly applied from inside the six-yard box. It was the fifth time in seven home Champions League games under Solskjaer that United had fallen behind. For the second, Demerai simply wanted it more as he climbed highest at a corner to power in the second, with both Shaw and Maguire ineffective in response. There had been agitation before the half-time whistle, which brought a lot of boos, before the singing section close to the tunnel offered more positive support, which Solskjaer acknowledged as he made his way towards the dressing rooms. Given the 45 minutes that had gone before and the task that lay in front of them in the second period, it was something of a surprise Solskjaer did not make a change at the break. It was almost a 'you got us into this mess, you get us out of it' move by the United boss. And it worked. United tore into their opponents and both Ronaldo and Rashford could have scored before the England man did, converting a brilliant pass from Bruno Fernandes by opening his body up and finding the far corner. McTominay hit a post and Ronaldo had another shot saved as United continued to build pressure, in much the same way as Sir Alex Ferguson's great teams used to when they found themselves in a spot of bother. The problem is Ferguson's teams tended to be defensively secure. Solskjaer's most definitely is not and David de Gea needed to make acrobatic saves to deny Luis Muriel and Ruslan Malinovskyi at a point when had they conceded again, United would surely have lost. As it was, they survived, regrouped and - with Pogba, Jadon Sancho and Cavani introduced - went again. Maguire's finish had plenty of feeling behind it. So had Ronaldo's celebration as he sank to his knees and did a double fist-pump after once more becoming the United hero. With Liverpool, Tottenham, another meeting with Atalanta and Manchester City to come before the next international break, no-one can be too sure where United go from here.

Ansu Fati grabbed the 70th-minute winner with a powerful strike from 10 yards after Oscar Mingueza's right-wing cross deflected into his path. Kyiv had good chances to score when it was goalless but Mykola Shaparenko twice shot wide when well placed. Barcelona lost 3-0 in both their opening two group games, but are now two points clear of Benfica in third. This was their first Champions League game since sacking manager Ronald Koeman last week with Barcelona B boss Sergi Barjuan in interim charge. Barca have reached the last 16 in each of the past 17 seasons and will secure their place in the knockout stages if they beat Benfica at home on 23 November. Defeat, however, would mean the Spanish side would have to win away at already-qualified Bayern Munich and hope Benfica drop points against Kyiv in matchday six. When it was goalless, Barcelona were awarded a penalty as Fati went down under a challenge, but the decision was reversed after a video assistant referee (VAR) review. The 19-year-old forward was celebrating minutes later with what proved to be the decisive goal. Kyiv had a chance to grab an equaliser late on, but visiting goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen made a fine one-handed save to keep out Victor Tsygankov's curling effort.

{"title": "Malmo 0-1 Chelsea: Hakim Ziyech scores only goal to give the Blues three points in Champions League", "content": "246 Reigning champions Chelsea moved closer to the last 16 of the Champions League with a hard-fought win over Malmo in Sweden. After being frustrated in the first half, the Blues went ahead when Hakim Ziyech converted at the back post following an excellent cross from Callum Hudson-Odoi. Thiago Silva nearly grabbed a second but his glancing header was cleared off the line by Anel Ahmedhodzic. It was another masterful defensive display from Thomas Tuchel's side, who denied Malmo a single shot on target. Chelsea have nine points from four matches in Group H and are three points behind Juventus, who booked their place in the last 16 with two games to spare when they  beat Zenit St Petersburg. Chelsea need one more point to join the Italians in the knockout stages. Malmo, managed by ex-Newcastle striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, were playing their 12th match in this season's competition after battling through four rounds of qualifying, knocking out Rangers on the way. However, they had suffered heavy losses in their three previous group matches, including a 4-0 defeat by Tuchel's team at Stamford Bridge in October. Only the form of home goalkeeper Johan Dahlin denied Chelsea a first-half goal as he kept out efforts, albeit sometimes unconvincingly, from Cesar Azpilicueta, Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Andreas Christensen, while England midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek twice narrowly missed the target. A capacity crowd at the Eleda Stadion produced a fine atmosphere with the home fans trying to inspire their team to their first Champions League point of the season. Top goalscorer Antonio Colak almost gave the supporters something to cheer about in first-half injury time as he showed great technique to connect with a volley from a long ball forward, but could only steer the shot wide. Soren Rieks also put a half volley wide early in the second half as the Swedish league leaders threatened to cause a shock. Loftus-Cheek, lively in only his fifth start of the season, had an effort parried by the erratic Dahlin before Marcos Alonso's glanced header was blocked. But Chelsea, just as they had done in their 3-0 win over Newcastle on Saturday, had to be patient before eventually making the breakthrough, which came in the 56th minute. Hudson-Odoi, on the right wing, played a one-two with Havertz and then produced an exquisite low cross which evaded Ahmedhodzic and Dahlin, with Ziyech putting the ball away at the back post. Chelsea were again without injured strike-pair Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, while Mason Mount had not recovered from an illness that also saw him miss the Newcastle game. But there was one returning player as United States midfielder Christian Pulisic came on as a second-half substitute for his first club appearance since August after an ankle injury had kept him out for two months. Another pleasing aspect for Tuchel was yet another impressive performance from his defence as they kept their 10th clean sheet from 17 matches in all competitions.

{"title": "Man City v PSG: Bernardo Silva takes weight off Kevin de Bruyne", "content": "With the amazing squad Manchester City have, for their manager to call someone \"undroppable\" means he must be doing something very special - and Bernardo Silva is in that bracket now. Pep Guardiola said last week that Silva's form means he cannot leave the 27-year-old out of his team at the moment, and I can understand why he thinks that. Along with Phil Foden and Joao Cancelo, the Portugal midfielder has been one of three standout players for City this season, which is remarkable when you think he almost left the club in the summer. Silva was reportedly unsettled for personal reasons but if he is still unhappy off the pitch, then he certainly doesn't show it when he is on it. It just shows how mentally strong he is and what type of person he is, that he's been able to just get on with his football and consistently produce the performances he has. There are only three players at City who will always play if they are available - Ederson in goal is one, Kyle Walker has nailed down the right-back slot and is another, and then there is Kevin de Bruyne. If De Bruyne is fit and City have a big game, he always starts - and so he should, because when he plays they are a better team. But we are getting to the stage where they are becoming less reliant on him because of Silva's form. He is a very different sort of player, but he still has a huge influence on the game. When the Belgium playmaker is missing, as he will be against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, we know Silva can take over the reins.  I don't mean he has the same ability, because I don't think he is as good a player - for me, De Bruyne is the best midfielder in the world.  But in terms of being that person City can count on every single week, Silva is certainly that man. Silva has operated as a forward on the right wing in the past and has played in three positions for City this season: as a false nine and on the left and right of the midfield three. It is those last two roles that fit him best in my opinion and have helped him shine, because when he is deeper he can get more involved in the game - going forward and defensively. He can do everything. I love his attitude and watching all the work he puts in for the team. You don't often get flair players who are great out of possession too, but it doesn't seem to bother Silva because he just does not stop running. It's the same when he is on the ball, which is one of the ways he is different to De Bruyne. Yes, De Bruyne breaks through defensive lines and is faster than people think, but when you think of him, it is his passing that makes him world class. With Silva, City have more of a dribbler from deep - when he was at Monaco his team-mates nicknamed him Bubblegum because the ball was always stuck to his feet, and it is something he does more than any other player for City. He's obviously very good at it too - the mazy run he went on against Liverpool last month was just staggering. De Bruyne is so elegant and easy on the eye that of course he gets many plaudits. Silva might not be quite as fancy but he is just as dependable, and definitely does a great job in a different way. His effort is always amazing, but he's far more than just a workhorse. I don't think he is under-rated - the City fans absolutely love him and you can see why Pep does, too. Silva's down-to-earth personality makes him a superstar player who is very easy to manage, like David Silva was during my time at the club. He and De Bruyne can play together, but maybe we don't always see the absolute best of both of them when they do because they both want to be in the same areas on the right side of midfield. When you watch Silva he always gravitates to the right so he can come inside on his left foot, and he does a lot of his best work there. That is obviously where De Bruyne likes to operate too, not normally by cutting in but by fizzing in one of his trademark crosses. When they are both in the team, they can't both be deployed there and it is usually Silva who has to move over to the left or further forward.  It works because Silva knows City's system and he is also good enough to be effective whatever he is asked to do. But when you play him in his best position, that's when you really see what he can do.  There is lots to look forward to in Wednesday's Champions League game against PSG, and it's exactly the stage where I'd expect Silva to shine - against players with much bigger reputations than him. City go into it without being under much pressure because they are top of Group A, but I remember the feeling - these games, against the best of the best, are when the top players want to show everyone how good they are. City don't need to win but they will want to make a statement. Lionel Messi is in town, and to see him live will be amazing.  The Etihad will be bouncing and the world will be watching - I can't wait to see what happens.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59382609"},
{"title": "Cristiano Ronaldo produces magical Man Utd moment to prompt Michael Jordan comparison", "content": "969 Four games, five goals, two late winners and an injury-time equaliser. Even by Cristiano Ronaldo's standards, this is a quite ridiculous Champions League campaign. Manchester United's season continues to be a bizarre mix of mad and magical moments, with their defence responsible for the former against Atalanta and Ronaldo yet again the supplier of the latter. With pressure once again mounting on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - and United at risk of slipping from top of the group to third place and having their last-16 fate taken out of their own hands - the competition's all-time top scorer delivered. Ronaldo had already bailed United out once with an equaliser before the break, but he saved the real drama for the 91st minute when he volleyed in from outside the box to level again and earn a 2-2 draw that keeps them top of Group F. \"It was a difficult game but we believed until the end. I helped my team to get one point and I'm so happy,\" said Ronaldo. \"We never give up. We believe until the end and it's a good result for us.\" Ronaldo has scored in all his side's group games this season, netting late winners against Villarreal and at home to Atalanta, before his double at a lively Gewiss Stadium. It was his 127th goal in 303 games in all competitions for Manchester United and he becomes the oldest player to score two or more in one game for the club in European competition. The 36-year-old is also the first player to score in four consecutive Champions League appearances for the club since Ruud van Nistelrooy in April 2003. \"We all have our roles and responsibilities,\" said Solskjaer. \"He is a leader. \"He does provide those moments. I am sure Chicago Bulls didn't mind having Michael Jordan. I know votes are coming up, Cristiano is getting better and better for us.\" Speaking to BT Sport, Solskjaer added: \"Cristiano is just incredible. \"That's what he does and if there's anyone you want the chance - and a difficult chance - to go to in the last minute it is him. His technique on that volley was incredible.\" Ronaldo's goals return this season - now nine in 11 in total - has never been in question but there has been criticism of his overall contribution. After the 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool, there were  suggestions  his presence affects United's ability to function effectively as a team. \"People say he doesn't work hard enough, doesn't close people down, doesn't press, but he does the hardest thing in the game - score goals,\" former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport. \"At that critical moment he steps up - in any country, in any stadium, at any time. He just arrives on the biggest occasions and delivers.\" Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said the second goal was inevitable as soon as it fell to Ronaldo on the edge of the Atalanta box. \"Atalanta will be kicking themselves that they haven't managed to see this through to a 2-1 victory,\" said Osman. \"You couldn't see how Manchester United could manipulate a chance but when it falls into the path of Cristiano Ronaldo you just know what's going to happen. \"Magical moment from a magical player and it was important. United needed to make sure they didn't lose that game.\" Despite Ronaldo's brilliance, United were second best for most of the fixture and a difficult week for Solskjaer's side continues at home to rivals Manchester City on Saturday. \"If United go out with that second-half performance against Manchester City they will get slapped again, three, four, five goals,\" said Ferdinand.  \"The intensity was not there. You look at it and you say what formation are they playing? It was in disarray. Ronaldo saved them in the second half. \"United were fortunate Atalanta didn't score any more and the great man stepped up.\" Former United midfielder Paul Scholes added: \"If it was not for that second goal it was a mess. Again, Ronaldo has pulled his team out of the mire from a poor second half.\" Atalanta manager Gian Piero Gasperini, having also seen his side surrender a two-goal lead in the defeat at Old Trafford, said that on a frustration scale of one to 100, he was \"1,000\". \"We believed we could do it,\" he added. \"It looked like they were all out of puff but we came up against an incredible player.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59143165"},

{"title": "Atalanta 2-2 Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo rescues visitors", "content": "1618 Cristiano Ronaldo once again rescued Manchester United with a sensational late goal to earn his side a draw against Atalanta that keeps them top of Champions League Group F.  The 36-year-old, who also levelled in first-half added time, volleyed in from outside the box in added time for his second of the night to earn United a crucial point in Bergamo. Josip Ilicic opened the scoring with a low effort that squeezed under David de Gea at a vociferous Gewiss Stadium and Atalanta thought Duvan Zapata's 56th-minute effort had won it. Ronaldo capped a wonderful move by firing beyond goalkeeper Juan Musso for his first following a delightful Bruno Fernandes back-heel, after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side had been on the back foot for much of the first half. United were also second best after the break but Ronaldo, who scored a late winner in the reverse fixture and against Villarreal, delivered with a vital goal to keep United in pole position heading into the final two group games.  At 2-1 down, United were sitting third in the group and facing the prospect of going out if they lost to Villarreal in their next fixture, but now a win would see them through with one game to spare. Many have questioned the impact of Ronaldo's return to United, but the Portugal great has proved in Europe's elite club competition there is no-one better for producing when it matters. Ronaldo has scored in each of United's group games, netting crucial winners, and once again showed his desire to rescue his side with an instinctive volley that found the bottom corner in the 91st minute. United had struggled to impose themselves on the fixture but they also produced the move of the match for Ronaldo to grab his first, pouncing on Fernandes' deft touch to level after a first half in which Solskjaer's side had battled to keep the hosts at bay. United's victory at Tottenham on Saturday was supposed to be a pivotal moment for Solskjaer, with Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo losing his job and Solskjaer's tactical tweaks suggesting a far more solid and resilient Reds side existed to the one thumped 5-0 by Liverpool a week earlier. The Norwegian stuck with a three-man defence for the trip to Bergamo, but the system could not account for a costly error from goalkeeper De Gea, who let a seemingly comfortable effort from Ilicic slip beneath him 12 minutes in after smart work on the left from Zapata. It was the ninth time in the 14 matches under Solskjaer in the Champions League they have conceded first and livewire forward Zapata had a huge chance to double the Serie A's side lead on the half-hour mark after Paul Pogba gave the ball away on the edge of his own box, with Eric Bailly making a vital block.  When centre-back Raphael Varane went down injured soon after, Solskjaer abandoned the three-man defence to instead bring on forward Mason Greenwood and it worked almost instantly as the substitute combined with Fernandes and Ronaldo in the sensational move that saw United level. But they were unable to wrangle the momentum after the break and Zapata ran clear to flick beyond De Gea, despite Harry Maguire thinking the goal, awarded after a lengthy VAR check, was initially offside.  It was Atalanta who looked more like adding to their lead, but Ronaldo has become accustomed to bailing out his side in the Champions League. The leveller was his 127th goal in all competitions for United and not only saw him overtake Solskjaer in the club's scoring charts but also helped ease the pressure on his former team-mate and now manager.

City's outstanding display reaped the reward it deserved, as they showed character as well as class after Kylian Mbappe swept PSG into a 50th-minute lead. PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino, heavily linked with Manchester United following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking, was left disappointed as City hit back in style to turn the game around.  Raheem Sterling's recent good run continued as he turned home Kyle Walker's far post touch to equalise after 63 minutes. Then substitute Gabriel Jesus was the beneficiary of an exquisite lay-off from Bernardo Silva to beat PSG keeper Kaylor Navas from close range 13 minutes later. PSG's superstar trio of Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar were a sporadic threat but City carried the greater danger and this was a well-merited victory, putting them into the last 16 before they travel to face RB Leipzig for their final Group A game,  which will be played  behind closed doors. For all PSG's attacking riches, it was Manchester City who carried the more concerted threat - with the only concern initially that they could not cash in on their domination.  Pep Guardiola's side were on the front foot from the first whistle and it required Presnel Kimpembe's header to deny Rodri, before Achraf Hakimi diverted a shot from Riyad Mahrez over the top.  City almost paid the price when John Stones lost possession and Mbappe shot over but City were calm, measured and always looked a more organised unit than their illustrious opponents. They were put to the test when Mbappe put PSG ahead against the run of play but City then struck the perfect balance between chasing the game and keeping the door locked at the back.  Sterling's resurgence continued with another goal and an energetic display while Jesus answered the regular questions about City not signing a striker with a predatory finish.  City then closed out the game with few alarms to ensure they will go into the draw for the knockout stage as group winners, always an advantage, and with the opportunity to rest players in that final group game behind closed doors in Leipzig with their Champions League job done.  It was the sort of performance City have been producing in the Champions League in recent seasons, as PSG discovered in last season's semi-final - now the task is to somehow find a way to make those successful steps through the next phase and fill that gap in their trophy cabinet.  The spotlight has been fixed firmly on Pochettino since his arrival in Manchester for this Champions League tie, coinciding with him becoming the heavy favourite to be appointed as the next permanent Manchester United manager.  He negotiated the inevitable pre-match questions with aplomb but will have returned to Paris disappointed after an average display from his side.  They can boast that brilliant attacking trio - but this seems to come at the expense of PSG resembling a Pochettino side, one full of urgency, intensity and pressing.  Messi showed some of the old touches while Mbappe demonstrated his blistering pace and eye for goal but Neymar was disappointing, too easily shrugged off the ball and missing a great chance to restore PSG's lead.  PSG seem like a mix-and-match group, in this tournament at least, with Pochettino struggling to achieve unity of purpose. No-one could ever write off a team with the world-class talent PSG possess but they need to show more. There is no doubt Manchester United will be watching with interest to see if Pochettino can really put his stamp on this team, where he has to balance the need to accommodate three magnificent players with the desire to play his trademark style.  PSG will be a danger to anyone once the knockout games get under way but they were second best here and no-one can begrudge City their win.

Trevoh Chalobah, who was making his first European start for the Blues, scored the opener before Reece James controlled a clearance and volleyed across Wojciech Szczesny to give Chelsea the advantage their dominant performance deserved.  A third soon followed with Juventus looking shell-shocked as a short, sharp interchange of passes gave Callum Hudson-Odoi the chance to slot home at the back post.  The scoring was completed when Hakim Ziyech capitalised on a mistake from Juve midfielder Weston McKennie to cross for Timo Werner to tap home in added time. It is the Italian club's heaviest defeat in the Champions League and demonstrated Chelsea's status as a serious contender to retain the trophy they won against Premier League rivals Manchester City in May.  The three points send Chelsea to the top of Group H but they must match Juventus' result in the final matchday on 8 December - when they travel to Zenit St Petersburg and the Turin club host Malmo - in order to stay there.  Tuchel, who has claimed 35 wins from 50 games as Chelsea boss, said the performance was \"sharper\" than the 1-0 defeat the Blues suffered in Turin in September.  Chelsea dominated that game, having 73% possession and 16 shots, but only had one effort on target and were undone by a Federico Chiesa strike 10 seconds after half-time.  \"We took more risks - that was something we lacked in Turin,\" Tuchel told BT Sport. \"By control you cannot hurt them - you need to penetrate with runs off the ball. \"It's so tough to create and score but we created so much. An amazing performance and a fantastic result.\" The only concern for Tuchel and Chelsea were the withdrawals of N'Golo Kante in the first half and Ben Chilwell in the second period through injury, with the Blues playing Manchester United on Sunday (16:30 GMT).  Chelsea have justifiably had a lot of praise for their defensive efficiency in the opening three months of the season and indeed since Tuchel arrived in January.  They have now conceded only 24 goals in the German's first 50 games in charge - a record for a manager in charge of a British club.  Tuchel's side started on the front foot and were rarely threatened at the back apart from an outstanding acrobatic clearance from Thiago Silva after former Blues striker Alvaro Morata had dinked onrushing keeper Edouard Mendy shortly after Chalobah's opener.  This performance also showcased Chelsea's attacking threat and other teams will note that was the case even with Romelu Lukaku - included for the first time since 20 October - Werner and Mason Mount all starting on the bench and Kai Havertz absent completely.  Chilwell should have opened the scoring in the first two minutes but had an air shot at a loose ball, before Chalobah sent a header wide and James saw a free-kick saved.  Chalobah's goal was another glimpse of his impressive instinct in front of goal - he has already scored twice in the Premier League this season - as he latched on to a loose ball and thumped the ball into the roof of the net.  James, Hudson-Odoi and Silva all saw efforts saved either side of the break before the England right-back superbly controlled a headed clearance, taking it away from the defender as he did so, before volleying past Szczesny and a couple of defenders who were attempting to get back.  The England defender joins Liverpool's Mohamed Salah as the only Premier League player to have scored five goals and provided five assists in all competitions this season.  Hudson-Odoi rounded off an excellent Chelsea performance with a composed finish after James, Hakim Ziyech and Ruben Loftus-Cheek combined in a slick move. Werner's goal was mere decoration, because it had long been certain that Chelsea's unbeaten run in all competitions would be extended to 10 games.  It was a performance that delighted a boisterous Stamford Bridge crowd, enthused by a team that is top of the Premier League by three points, is in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and is in the box seat to win their Champions League group.

{"title": "Mohamed Salah: Liverpool forward is 'best in the business, without Messi and Ronaldo era'", "content": "1245 Mohamed Salah's contract situation might not be clear, but the forward's status as an all-time Liverpool great is hardly in doubt. Salah has been in the form of his life so far this season and his  goal against AC Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday  took his tally to 20 in all competitions - and we've only reached 7 December. By date, only Reds legends Ian Rush (7 November) and Roger Hunt (25 November) have reached the landmark more quickly than Salah, who has also provided nine assists. It was not a stellar showing from the former Fiorentina and Roma player at the San Siro, but he was still given a standing ovation by the home supporters when he made his way off the pitch just after the hour mark. \"Without the era of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, how would we think of Mohamed Salah right now?\" asked Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"We would think of him as the best in the business.\" Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon said: \"Mohamed Salah is up there with any other player I've seen in the past few years. He is the closest player I've seen to Lionel Messi.\" Liverpool fell behind to England defender Fikayo Tomori's effort for AC Milan before Salah equalised on 36 minutes for Jurgen Klopp's men. The forward was quickest to react to goalkeeper Mike Maignan's save from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot, firing in a first-time finish from the rebound into the roof of the net. \"He thinks about things in a different way. He seems to get power out of his left foot in a way that only Lionel Messi can,\" said Nevin. However, there are still questions about Salah's long-term future at Anfield, with the Egyptian yet to sign a new contract and his current deal set to expire in 2023. Reds boss Klopp had sounded optimistic this week that his star man will agree a new deal, something former Anfield striker Michael Owen also believes will happen. Owen told BT Sport: \"His contract will get sorted out, but these things are complicated. This is probably the last big contract of his career so he's got to take his time about things.  \"Where can he go at the minute? Spanish football is struggling.\" Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand added: \"Do you think he is sitting there with his agent and saying 'just go and search out the highest paid player in the league and put me a couple of pound above them'? He's the best player in the league at the moment.\" When Liverpool, Atletico Madrid, Porto and AC Milan were drawn together in August, Group B was described as the 'Group of Death' but Klopp's side swept all three sides aside with ease. They become the first English side in history to win all six games in a Champions League group stage, scoring 17 times and conceding six goals. The Reds also won six successive Champions League matches for the first time, despite making a number of changes to their starting line-up, finishing an incredible 11 points clear of second-placed Atletico. \"I'm very proud,\" said Klopp. \"Especially because of the sixth game to be honest. We chose that line-up because we wanted to win the game. We needed fresh legs. We needed desire to play this game which is difficult in this hectic schedule to always be on fire for the next game. \"What the boys did, I could not be more proud. It was an incredible game. I am so happy.  \"The performance was outstanding. Having 21 shots, so many situations where we played outstandingly well and defended passionately and well organised.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59572726"},

Toni Kroos scored the opener for Real and Marco Asensio curled in the second. Former Germany international midfielder Kroos' effort was the La Liga side's 1,000th goal in the European Cup, becoming the first club to reach that landmark. Substitute Asensio's strike - a minute after coming on - was a beauty, picking the ball up on the edge of the box and caressing a finish into the top corner. Carlo Ancelotti's men could have doubled their lead before half-time but Rodrygo struck the foot of the post and smashed into the side-netting from a promising position shortly after.

It is an action-packed 12 months, starting with the FA Cup third round and Africa Cup of Nations, Premier League and Women's Super League title races and then the delayed Women's European Championship in July - and ending with the men's World Cup in Qatar in November and December. Here are some of the things you can look forward to... We won't have to wait long for the first international tournament with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, Chelsea's Edouard Mendy and Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez among those competing in the Africa Cup of Nations from 9 January-6 February in Cameroon.  Coverage of the quarter-finals onwards will be on BBC TV, as part of 10 games being shown live, with highlights of the earlier stages available on the BBC Sport website and app, as Algeria look to retain the trophy they won in 2019.  The Uefa Women's Euros, which were due to take place in 2021, will then take centre stage with hosts England facing Austria at Old Trafford in the first game on 6 July.  England will also face Northern Ireland and Norway in the group stage, while holders the Netherlands come up against Sweden, who finished third in the 2019 World Cup, in one of the standout matches.  All 31 games will be available live across BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.  History will then be made at the back end of the year when the men's Fifa World Cup is staged in winter for the first time - with the tournament taking place between 21 November and 18 December in Qatar. England have already booked their spot, while Scotland and Wales will attempt to join them in March's qualifiers, alongside the last two winners of the European Championship, Portugal and Italy. There will be comprehensive coverage of that tournament across BBC TV and BBC digital platforms.  We have had some exciting Premier League title races in recent years, but they have generally involved two teams. This year Chelsea and Liverpool will both be hoping to battle Manchester City for the title.  The top-four race and fight for survival seem certain to go down to the wire so make sure to follow all the action in our live text commentaries, on BBC Radio 5 Live or by watching Match of the Day. We already know that the 2022-23 season will take a  break of almost six weeks  for the World Cup - with fixtures ending after 13 November before resuming on 26 December.  The Women's Super League is also set to be hotly contested with Arsenal looking to win their first title since 2019 and Chelsea aiming to make it three on the bounce.  Champions League qualification and relegation are also tight and should provide plenty of entertainment in the second half of the season.  There will be regular games on BBC TV with radio and live text commentary available on the BBC Sport website and app.  With all four English teams through to the knockout stages of the Champions League, and West Ham and Leicester in the Europa League and Conference League respectively, there is plenty of interest in the elite European competitions this year.  Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United all feature at the top end of the bookmakers' market for the Champions League with Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain also fancied.  Chelsea will also look to become world champions in the Club World Cup in February.  Back at home, the men's and women's FA Cup will also feature across the BBC and as always should provide plenty of drama and upsets along the way.  We already know Manchester City's dominance of the Carabao Cup will end, with a new winner crowned on 27 February.  Transfer windows can often be built up and end up letting you down, but surely the two in 2022 can't do that? Who will Newcastle look to sign after their Saudi Arabian-backed £305m takeover made them the richest club in the country? They have been linked with stellar names including Paris St-Germain's Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid's Eden Hazard, but with a relegation battle looming who will Eddie Howe be able to attract to Tyneside?  Mbappe will be a free agent by the summer and has been persistently linked with Real Madrid, while the release clause in Erling Braut Haaland's Borussia Dortmund contract will become active in the summer, making a move more likely. Manchester City will be in the market for a striker, Manchester United are likely to have a new manager in the summer who will want his own players and Chelsea and Liverpool will want to keep up with them.  Meanwhile, Barcelona - mired in financial problems - are going to need to be savvy if they are going to give themselves a chance of Champions League qualification next season. It should be very busy.  Gareth Southgate will probably have a pretty good idea of the squad that he intends to take to Qatar, but as we all know injuries and loss of form can impact heavily on selection, especially with the tournament being mid-season.  We've already seen Crystal Palace loanee Conor Gallagher make his full England debut this year, while Roma's Tammy Abraham has forced his way back into contention and both will feature heavily in Southgate's thoughts. Could there be a late surge from Palace's Marc Guehi or Eberechi Eze, Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah or maybe even Manchester City's Cole Palmer? ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59496114"},

After Tuesday's games,  12 teams are through, with four spots in the last 16 still up for grabs. In the Europa League, West Ham, Leicester, Celtic and Rangers have had mixed campaigns, while Tottenham's chances of progressing in the Europa Conference League are hanging in the balance. Here is the state of play. Manchester City, Liverpool, Ajax, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester United.  Juventus, Chelsea, Paris St-Germain, Sporting Lisbon, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan. Besiktas, RB Leipzig, Malmo, Dynamo Kyiv, Young Boys, Zenit St Petersburg, Club Bruges, Borussia Dortmund, Sheriff Tiraspol, Shakhtar Donetsk, Porto, AC Milan,  Barcelona, Benfica Villarreal, Atalanta Red Bull Salzburg, Lille, Wolfsburg, Sevilla Despite  losing 2-1 to RB Leipzig  in their final group game, Manchester City win Group A and will be seeded in Monday's draw, where they are joined by Paris St-Germain. There will be plenty of clubs hoping to avoid Liverpool in the last-16 draw after they made it six wins out of six - and won Group B with an 11-point cushion. Atletico Madrid, who had started the final matchday bottom of the group, advance courtesy of a  3-1 win at Porto. Like Liverpool, Ajax also emerge from the group stage with a 100% winning record. Sporting Lisbon knew they were through before Tuesday's 4-2 defeat by Ajax. Real Madrid needed to win their final game against Inter Milan to seal top spot in Group D. The record 13-times winners  beat their opponents 2-0.  Inter also progress as runners-up. Barcelona face a tense group stage finale away to runaway leaders Bayern Munich. Defeat or a draw for Barca - and a win for Benfica, who host bottom club Dynamo Kyiv - will send the five-time European champions down into the Europa League.   Manchester United not only qualified for the knockout stage with a win away to Villarreal - they also sealed top spot after Atalanta were held to a 3-3 draw by Young Boys.  The Italians will join United in the last 16 if they beat Villarreal in their final game. There is still everything to play for as the tightest of groups reaches its finale. Lille start the final round of group games top but could yet miss out as just three points separate the four teams.  Reigning champions Chelsea are through to the last 16, as are Juventus. If the Blues match or better Juve's result in the last round of games, they will win the group.  Lyon, Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen, West Ham.

The play-offs will be contested between the eight Europa League group runners-up and the eight third-ranked teams from the Champions League groups. Rangers' final group game is away to Lyon on 9 December. Leicester moved from bottom of the group to the top thanks to a 3-1 win over Legia Warsaw, but Brendan Rodgers' side need to get at least a draw in their final game at Napoli to advance. Only a win in Italy would be enough to guarantee top spot.  All four teams in the group can still advance. Celtic's 3-2 loss to Bayer Leverkusen means the Scottish side will be dropping down to the Conference League, with Leverkusen guaranteed top spot and Real Betis finishing second. West Ham's 2-0 win away at Rapid Vienna means the Hammers top the group with a game to spare and jump straight into the last 16, avoiding the qualifying round play-off.   AZ Alkmaar, FC Copenhagen, Feyenoord, Gent, LASK, Rennes. Maccabi Tel Aviv, Bodo Glimt, Roma, Basel, Qarabag.  Partizan Belgrade, Flora, Anorthosis Famagusta, Randers, Jablonec, Slavia Prague, Union Berlin, Maccabi Haifa, Slovan Bratislava, PAOK Salonika, Tottenham, Vitesse Arnhem.  HJK Helsinki, Alashkert, Zorya Luhansk, CSKA Sofia, Cluj, Lincoln Red Imps, Mura, Omonia, Kairat Tottenham looked to be in a strong position to qualify, before they suffered a surprise, last-gasp 2-1 loss to Mura. If they and Vitesse Arnhem finish level on points both teams have a similar record in the head-to-head of one win and one loss apiece and three goals both scored and conceded (away goals scored no longer counts). Therefore, if the two teams end on the same points it will go down to overall goal difference. Spurs are currently two goals better off in that respect. However, Tottenham could still be eliminated even if they beat Rennes.

{"title": "Champions League returns: What to look out for in 2021-22 knockout stages", "content": "A clean sweep of English teams but no Barcelona. No away goals either.  The Champions League last 16 starts this week with Paris St-Germain v Real Madrid and Sporting Lisbon v Manchester City on Tuesday. Let's jog your memory on who is still in it and what to look out for. This is the first time in 18 years that Barcelona are not in the Champions League knockout stages. Spanish newspaper AS called it Barcelona's \"resignation from the football elite\" as they lost 3-0 to Bayern Munich to finish third (Barca's third 3-0 defeat in their six games). Instead of competing for club football's most prestigious trophy, they will be facing Napoli (who finished above Leicester) in a play-off for a place in the Europa League last 16. The last time they were not in the Champions League last 16 was in 2004 when they lost to Celtic in the Uefa Cup. Their exit might feel strange but could just save them further embarrassment down the line. The past three times they got to the last eight or further ended in farce - blowing three-goal leads against Roma and Liverpool and losing 8-2 to Bayern Munich. For the fourth time in five seasons there are at least four English teams in the Champions League last 16 - all getting there with a game to spare this time. And three of them are among the four bookmakers' favourites to win the tournament (Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Chelsea). All the English sides face domestic champions of four of Europe's next five highest-ranked leagues (Spain, Italy, France, Portugal).  However, none of those currently top their league. Last season Chelsea beat City in the final - could it be a similar tale this year? Can Pep Guardiola finally get his hands on the trophy without Barcelona and Lionel Messi? The last-16 teams come from eight different leagues - including  knockout debutants Red Bull Salzburg. Salzburg, Ajax, Benfica and Sporting Lisbon mean there are more teams from outside Europe's top five leagues than in the previous three years combined (Porto in 2021 and 2019 and Ajax in 2019). Ajax - the second top scorers in the Champions League this season with 20 - and Sporting came through the same group together above Borussia Dortmund. There could be a new top scorer too, with Ajax's Sebastien Haller leading the way on 10 goals (from only six games) and RB Leipzig's Christopher Nkunku joint third on seven goals. The Champions League last-16 draw had to be done twice after mistakes were made in the original draw. Manchester United were excluded from the pot of possible opponents for Atletico Madrid, and Liverpool included instead. But it should have been the other way around. The entire draw was redone, leaving some teams with tougher ties and others with \"easier\" games. Manchester United were initially due to play one of the tournament favourites in Paris St-Germain - Cristiano Ronaldo v Messi as it was briefly billed before the problems emerged. Now they play Atletico Madrid, who are outside the top four in La Liga. PSG presumably would have preferred the initial United draw as they ended up with Real Madrid. Liverpool had an upgrade in opponent with Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg being replaced by Serie A champions and leaders Inter Milan. Manchester City will play Sporting Lisbon instead of Villarreal, while Chelsea were drawn with Lille both times. Among the other teams with strong swings in the new draw were Bayern Munich, who were due to play Atletico Madrid and now play Salzburg. Real Madrid were due to face Benfica, but now take on PSG. These will be the first Champions League knockout stages since Uefa scrapped the away-goals rule. Ties with level scores after two legs will now all go to extra time and then penalties.  It could well change the dynamic of knockout games. Tottenham's famous wins over Ajax and City would both have gone to extra time under these new rules. So too would have United's comeback win over PSG that helped Ole Gunnar Solskjaer get the manager's job, and Roma's fightback against Barcelona. When PSG signed Messi, it was not to help them reclaim the Ligue 1 title - it was so they could win the Champions League. PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. They have three of the best forwards in world football - Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. PSG rejected a £137m Real Madrid bid for Mbappe last summer despite the fact he can leave on a free transfer in July - so this could be the only season they have that frontline. Plus with Messi turning 35 this summer, they will not have too many campaigns with the Argentine. The move could be mutually beneficial too, with Messi hoping to win his first Champions League since 2015 after leaving a Barcelona team that got worse every year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60250316"},

{"title": "Ruben Amorim: Sporting Lisbon boss making huge impact and drawing comparisons to Jose Mourinho", "content": "Sporting Lisbon fans jokingly refer to it as \"the best moment of the week\". That is not when their team take to the pitch, but instead when manager Ruben Amorim speaks. Given how successful the Portuguese giants have been lately, it just highlights how much Amorim is revered by the green half of Lisbon. The club's supporters have even started  a social media account  where they count down the days to his news conferences. The 37-year-old former international, merely a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups - has revolutionised the art of managerial communication and brought a breath of fresh air to a country whose football discussions are mostly dominated by rivalry nonsense. A natural-born leader, he has transformed a club that had been constantly at war with itself for over a decade, having reached its lowest point in May 2018 when masked ultras broke into the training ground to  attack players and staff members with sticks and belts . In what was deemed a miracle, Amorim managed to end a 19-year league title drought last season after bookmakers had given them only a 3% chance of winning it, behind Benfica, Porto and Braga. Sporting have now reached the Champions League last 16 for the second time in their history, but do not expect him to brag about that before Tuesday's game against Manchester City at the Alvalade stadium. Despite being touted as arguably the best Portuguese coach to have emerged since Jose Mourinho in the early 2000s, this is a man who does not get carried away easily. Whenever he is on the microphone, he still comes across as someone who does not take himself very seriously and speaks his mind freely. \"The perfect word to describe him is 'genuine',\" his close friend and centre-back Bruno Simao, who has known him since the age of nine, explained to BBC Sport.  \"Nobody tells him what to say. When he sits in front of the cameras, fans know that's him, not some product of media training.\" Former Brazilian striker Evandro Roncatto got to play by his side and also worked under him.  \"He has no time for silly games, he's straightforward, he doesn't lie to you,\" he said. \"We've got to admire somebody like this.\" Sporting fans certainly do and now recognise in Amorim the biggest star of their team. When Amorim was first unveiled by Sporting in March 2020, however, there were a lot of raised eyebrows. The decision to pay the 10m euros buyout clause of a manager who, three months before, still found himself working in the Portuguese third tier with Braga's B side - and was yet to complete a full season on the bench - was called \"madness\" by club legend Luis Figo. The fee made him the third-most expensive coach in history. Regardless of the impact Amorim had made right away for Braga's first team, winning 10 out of 13 games, including a 7-1 thrashing of Belenenses SAD on his debut and victories over Porto (twice), Sporting (twice) and Benfica, it sounded like a desperate move. Not even the fact he had lifted the League Cup in the process did much to convince doubters. On top of that, he did not have the necessary coaching badges to work in the top flight and, as a result, could not give instructions and be registered as manager on matchdays. He was instead listed as an assistant. Sporting still chose to go ahead with the deal and so, in his first news conference, Amorim delivered the message that has defined his time. \"What if it goes well?\" he asked. So far, it has gone amazingly well - no-one will dispute that. \"People thought the 10m euros fee Sporting agreed for him was insane, but they don't even mention it anymore. It's now a bargain,\" Simao said. In less than two years, Amorim has led the Lions to a Portuguese league title, a Supercup and two League Cup triumphs, giving young players a chance to shine along the way.  While left-back Nuno Mendes has been snapped up by Paris St-Germain, others like Pedro Goncalves, Matheus Nunes, Pedro Porro and Goncalo Inacio are on the same path. A combative midfielder who struggled with injuries for most of his career and had to retire prematurely at the age of 32, Amorim has never hidden the fact he has been a fan of cross-town rivals Benfica his whole life. It says a lot about the work he has been doing that Sporting supporters do not even seem to care about it. Until late last month, they had, in fact, never witnessed their side lose a home game in a domestic competition during his reign. Carlos Carvalhal's Braga were the first team to beat them at Alvalade. Unsurprisingly, other clubs have already tried to lure him away from Lisbon. He's reportedly turned down an offer to take charge of RB Leipzig and  been linked  with Manchester United and Leeds United. \"A while ago,\" Roncatto recalls, \"when I was working as sporting director of Pinhalnovense, we had a friendly game at their training ground and I told Amorim 'this is your last season in Portugal'. He just smiled back.  \"But he deserves all this. He's a pure guy and remains loyal to the staff who have been with him since his first job with Casa Pia in 2018.\" His release clause this time is set at 30m euros.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60340402"},

Milan's hopes rose on the half-hour when Takumi Minamino missed a near-post corner and goalkeeper Alisson could only push the ball out to England defender Fikayo Tomori, who scored from close range.  Liverpool's line-up may have had an unfamiliar appearance but they were by far the more accomplished side. Mohamed Salah was in the starting line-up and once again demonstrated his predatory instincts with the equaliser seven minutes later, driving home the rebound after Milan keeper Mike Maignan saved from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.  It meant the prolific Salah became the first Liverpool player since Ian Rush to score 20 goals in five successive seasons, also scoring the most goals for the club in the group stage of a European competition with seven.  Liverpool continued to dominate and Divock Origi scored his first goal in the competition since the 2019 Champions League final against Tottenham when he headed in after Maignan saved from Mane 10 minutes after the break.  When the draw for Champions League Group B was made, it was regarded as one of the toughest sections as Liverpool faced Atletico Madrid, Porto and AC Milan. Instead, they made a mockery of suggestions this could be a tight squeeze by ending with an astonishing 11-point advantage over second-placed Atletico,  who beat Porto to go through with them .  Liverpool are now so well-oiled a machine that Klopp could change the face of his team to such an extent after Saturday's win at Wolves and still put out a side that looked dangerous, well-organised and far too good for one of European football's biggest names.  Nathaniel Phillips slotted smoothly into defence with Virgil van Dijk left out and, apart from the goal and a late save from Franck Kessie, Liverpool and keeper Alisson survived virtually untroubled, looking far more likely to add to their advantage than concede another goal.  It was another graphic demonstration of the power of the Premier League as Milan, who head Serie A, were outmanoeuvred with ease by a Liverpool side bearing little resemblance to their full-strength team.  Liverpool will enter the last 16 as one of the most feared teams in the tournament, with their biggest threats appearing to come from Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City, along with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.  Klopp and his players, however, will progress with real confidence that they can once again make it into the latter stages of the Champions League after this latest show of strength.

{"title": "Juventus 1-0 Malmo: Moise Kean goal gives Juve win as they top Champions League Group H", "content": "Juventus beat Malmo to finish above Chelsea and advance to the Champions League last 16 as Group H winners. Ex-Everton striker Moise Kean headed the winner from a great cross from the right wing by Federico Bernardeschi, using the outside of his left boot. Malmo offered little as an attacking threat and finish bottom of the group. Juve had looked set to finish second but Chelsea conceded a late goal in  their 3-3 draw at Zenit St Petersburg  to send Juve through as group winners. Chelsea would have taken top spot if they had finished level on points with the Italians, courtesy of a better head-to-head record after beating Juve 4-0 at Stamford Bridge last month. However, Magomed Ozdoev's 94th-minute equaliser for Zenit in Russia handed Juventus top spot, and sparked scenes of celebration at the Allianz Stadium. It means they will avoid Manchester City, Liverpool, Ajax, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester United and whoever wins Group G in the next round in February. The draw for the last 16 takes place at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday at 11:00 GMT. This was a routine victory for Juve, who had already missed chances with Daniele Rugani heading wide and Kean shooting wide, before the latter grabbed his first Champions League goal for the club. After the break, Adrien Rabiot's effort was just off target, while Bernardeschi forced a fine save from away goalkeeper Ismael Diawara. Malmo, managed by ex-Newcastle striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, are now out of European competition for 2021-22. However, they clinched the Swedish league title earlier this week and will be in the first qualifying round of next season's Champions League.

{"title": "Paris St-Germain 1-0 Real Madrid: Kylian Mbappe scores late to give PSG advantage", "content": "243 Kylian Mbappe scored a brilliant goal in stoppage time as Paris St-Germain beat 13-time Champions League winners Real Madrid in the first leg of their last-16 tie. The France striker, linked with a move to Real in the summer, received the ball on the left from a clever backheel by Neymar, and got between two defenders inside the box before slotting through Thibaut Courtois' legs to send the Parc des Princes wild. It was a dramatic finish to a game that had looked set to end in frustration for PSG, especially after Lionel Messi saw his penalty saved just after the hour mark. The hosts had dominated possession but struggled to break down a well-organised Real defence that had limited PSG to one shot on target in the first half, when Mbappe saw a shot denied by Courtois' legs.  But the introduction of Neymar, making his first appearance since November after recovering from injury, proved decisive. He caused Real a number of problems with his dangerous crosses and clever runs before providing the crucial pass for Mbappe to work his magic with seconds remaining. The win will give PSG hope that they can head to Madrid on Wednesday, 9 March and get the result they need to keep alive their hopes of winning a first Champions League title. All the build-up to the game had centred on Mbappe and how the striker would perform in what  appeared to be an audition  against his future employers. The 23-year-old is one of the best players in the world right now and has been in superb form this season, with his goalscoring prowess pulling PSG out of difficult circumstances a number of times. Just a few days ago, he scored in the 93rd minute to secure a 1-0 win at Rennes in Ligue 1 - and once again he had the decisive impact in this game. Real, to their credit, had defended superbly for so long, with their doubling up on Mbappe having largely limited his impact. But the introduction of Neymar in the closing stages gave the visitors an additional threat to deal with and in turn more space for Mbappe to cause problems. There was relief for Real when Mbappe saw a shot from the edge of the area beat Courtois but bounce just wide of the far post late on but in the end he was not to be denied the match-winning moment. The goal was Mbappe's 22nd in another incredible season for the youngster and his performance will surely have only served to enhance Real's desire for him to be leading their line next term.

{"title": "Sporting Lisbon 0-5 Man City: Stellar City smash Sporting in Portugal", "content": "1820 Manchester City effectively sealed their progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League with a stunning last-16, first-leg demolition of Sporting Lisbon in Portugal. As they have done for much of this season, City put on a majestic display to give themselves a surely unassailable advantage in a tie against what had been a buoyant and reinvigorated Portuguese champions. Bernardo Silva was brilliant, silencing the boos that greeted every touch from him and City's three other former Benfica players with his side's second and fourth goals, the first a glorious half-volley following a corner. In-form Riyad Mahrez was on the scoresheet again with a close-range finish awarded via VAR after a lengthy delay to assess if Kevin de Bruyne had strayed offside in the build-up, as originally ruled. Phil Foden also added to his growing collection of cool, calm finishes in a relentless first half that shattered Sporting. There was no let-up after the break, with Silva seeing a hat-trick headed goal ruled out for offside before he set up Raheem Sterling to curl in a lovely fifth. The result equals the biggest winning margin in an away match in the Champions League knockout phase and gives City their joint biggest European away victory, level with the 5-0 win at Steaua Bucharest in the play-off round of this competition in 2016-17. Sporting will travel to Manchester for the formality of the second leg on Wednesday, 16 March. \"I am absolutely more than delighted,\" said Guardiola. \"We know how difficult it is, this competition. We were so clinical - arrive, goal, arrive, goal, arrive, goal. When it is like this it is difficult for the opponent. \"We defended well and got an incredible result but we have a duty as a manager and team to analyse how we performed, not just the result. \"We have to take care of the ball better. One of the rules I have is when you have the ball try to pass to someone in the same T-shirt. Today we lost the ball many times. \"The difference was that we were so clinical. Then it is difficult for the opponents and we have confidence. It is a dream, a perfect result, so good for the second leg but we can do better.\" Pep Guardiola's City remain a domestic behemoth, with a fourth Premier League title in five years now theirs to lose after taking 43 points from the past 45 available to leave them nine points clear at the top of the table. In Europe, though, they are ravenous for a success that has so far eluded their expensively-assembled, uber-talented squad - their hunger only deepened by the 1-0 loss to Chelsea in last season's final. Such appetite was on full display in Portugal's capital in a showcase of all that that is good about Guardiola's team - effort, awareness, patience and precision combining to lay the foundation for untouchable attacking excellence. Mahrez's early goal - awarded after a very lengthy VAR delay - burst the bubble of the home side, who were then simply dismantled, most notably and painfully by a former employee of their fiercest rivals. Silva is a magician of a footballer, doing the simple things relentlessly well but also making the ridiculously hard look routine. Few players can rifle a rising ball in on the half-volley as he did in the 17th minute, with a dramatic cannon off the underside of the bar an aesthetic bonus. \"I always tell him 'you are the perfect player',\" added Guardiola. \"With the ball he is more than exceptional, but I always say to him you have to score goals, go and win games, you have to have the ability to do it.  \"He scored one of the best goals I've seen for the technique, for everything. \"This was his home town, and he loves coming back here. Of course he is a former Benfica player, so this was special for him tonight.\" In any other game, Sterling finding the top corner with a precise curling shot to go joint second with Paul Scholes on the list of leading English goalscorers in the Champions League with 24 would make more headlines. But not this one. As a telling comparison of City's growing authority, their efforts in Lisbon made them the first team to score as many as four goals in the first half of a Champions League knockout tie since Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8-2 in the last eight en route to winning the trophy in 2020. There was precious little Sporting could do to stem the tide, their fans left only to offer sporting applause to City's brilliance as the goals rained in. However, while teams have been blown away this season without ever laying a glove on City, Ruben Amorim's side at least provided small glimpses of what they are about with short periods of neat passing and well-worked but ultimately fruitless openings down the flanks. Sporting have made giant strides both on and off the field in the past two years to unite again after the  training ground attack by hooligans in May 2018  and to once again compete for silverware. As a sign of the progress made, their players left the field to applause, singing and twirling scarves from a loyal, appreciative support who stuck by their side until the very end. As for City, last year's final defeat still rankles and they may well never have a better chance to win it than this year. It is looking like this is a very winnable competition for Manchester City this season. What Pep had done is incredible, the way he has transformed the whole club.  They had success before but not to this level and you will see Man City fans who will say he is amazing even if he doesn't win the Champions League.  But, for him, it is there and he would love nothing more to go and win this competition. Formation    3-4-2-1 Formation    4-3-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60379022"},

They expect to find \"common ground\" with European football's governing body, a meeting of the leagues' general assembly heard on Friday. Uefa's executive committee is next month expected to confirm a new Champions League format from 2024. \"We have had very good dialogue with Uefa,\" said Claus Thomsen, chairman of the European Leagues' management board. Uefa agreed plans for a revamped 36-team tournament  in April last year, one day after 12 clubs formed a now-cancelled 'European Super League'. The new proposals would allow two teams, who fail to qualify through their domestic leagues, entry to the Champions League based on a five-year 'Uefa club co-efficient'.  Critics say this favours the traditionally 'bigger' clubs and gives them a safety net if they perform poorly in a season. But Thomsen added: \"I think we will find common ground on this. \"Our expectation is that Uefa also has the position of sporting merit being at the core of European and domestic competitions.\" Earlier this month, the Football Supporters' Association's Premier League Network labelled Uefa's scheme  \"a return to the discredited idea of a European Super League\". \"We call on Uefa to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family,\" it said.

{"title": "Liverpool 0-1 Inter Milan (2-1 on agg)", "content": "2331 Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool deserve to be in the Champions League quarter-finals despite some \"slapstick\" finishing as they were beaten by Inter Milan in the second leg of their last-16 tie at Anfield. An outstanding finish by Lautaro Martinez was not enough for the Italian champions as the late goals by Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in the first leg in Milan three weeks ago proved decisive. \"The art of football is to lose the right games,\" said manager Klopp after Liverpool's seven-match winning run in Europe this season came to a disappointing end.  \"I still hate it, but if there was any game we could have afforded to lose it was this one because the main target of this competition is to get through. \"It's not that I am over the moon - I'm really happy we went through, because when we saw the draw it was 'OK, that's a tough one'. But we went through over two legs and I think we deserved it. \"It's a big 'if' but if we had used our chances from set-pieces and other situations - it was a bit slapstick how we missed the chances - in the end we could still have won the game. \"But the only thing I'm interested in is that it is fair we are through.\" Martinez gave Alisson no chance with an arrowed finish from 20 yards in the 61st minute. But Inter's hopes of forcing extra time with a second goal faded when former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez was sent off just two minutes later for a second yellow card. Liverpool hit the woodwork three times in a bad-tempered game which, in addition to Sanchez's red card, saw six other players booked. After Joel Matip headed against the bar, Salah struck the post twice in front of the Kop.  The draw for the last eight takes place on 18 March in Nyon, Switzerland. The game was also stopped for a few minutes in the first half due to a medical emergency in the crowd. There was a sense of relief around Anfield at full-time after Liverpool suffered a scare before booking their place in the last eight. The Reds were far from their best, but looked in control of the tie until Martinez's excellent strike, and Sanchez's dismissal then gave the hosts fresh momentum. A first defeat of 2022, after a terrific run in which they have delivered a trophy with the EFL Cup, will serve as a reminder to Klopp that there is still work to do if they are to end the season with more success. Having scored 109 goals in their previous 43 games, this was a rare occasion they failed to find the net. Liverpool did everything but score, though, as they rattled the bar and post, while substitute Luis Diaz was denied at point-blank range in the dying stages by Arturo Vidal's block. One positive for Klopp was the performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who seems to get better and better the longer the season goes on. He was at the heart of all his side's best moves and went close to scoring from a free-kick at the end of the first half. This defeat came almost a year to the day since Liverpool's last defeat at Anfield. Mario Lemina scored the only goal to give relegation-threatened Fulham a surprise away win on 7 March 2021. Liverpool had gone 28 games unbeaten at home - winning 21 and drawing seven - before Inter's first victory over the Reds since 1965. Despite the loss, Klopp's men have now reached the Champions League quarter-final stage for the fourth time in the last five seasons.

Former Celtic winger Marian Shved netted either side of Mohamed Simakan's strike for 2-1. And the visitors claimed a superb 4-1 win courtesy of further goals from the impressive 21-year-old Mykhaylo Mudryk and ex-Ajax forward Lassina Traore. In Group F's other game, champions Real Madrid  overcame Celtic 3-0 . But the night belonged to Shakhtar, who are unbeaten since their domestic league resumed last month following Russia's invasion in February. The club has been ravaged by war, unable to play at home since 2014 and seeing key players such as David Neres, Dodo and Marlon Solomon all departing this summer. In July,  the club said they were demanding 50m euros (£43m) damages from Fifa for lost transfer fees after football's world governing body ruled that foreign players in the country could suspend their contracts following Russia's invasion. But they have defied all the odds and after their opening Champions League group game have already collected more points (3) and more goals (4) than they earned in the entirety of last season's group stages when they finished with two points and two goals. \"I could not have imagined in my wildest dreams such a game with four goals for us,\" said captain Taras Stepanenko. \"But we played well and I feel we deserved that result tonight. \"Yes, it is right I have been with the club for over a decade. This is a new team, but many of these young players are from the Shakhtar academy so they have the Shakhtar spirit and this really helps us a lot.\" One of those youngsters is star forward Mudryk, who was  reportedly  chased by Premier League side Brentford during the summer, with a move failing to materialise as the £30m asking price was not met. And he showcased his potential on the biggest stage with a cool finish into the bottom corner, as well as providing two assists. Winger Shved, who made three appearances for Celtic in the 2019-20 campaign, signed last week for Shakhtar and had a dream Champions League debut with two goals. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso international Traore spent nine months out of action after suffering a knee injury in this competition last September. He is the only foreign player remaining at the club from before Russia's invasion and wrote on Instagram last week it \"doesn't feel right\" leaving as he \"always felt supported by everyone at Shakhtar\" during his rehabilitation.

{"title": "Bayern Munich: Can Bundesliga club be better without Robert Lewandowski?", "content": "116 Bayern Munich are known for conducting transfer business as quietly as possible - this summer was different. Robert Lewandowski, who had played eight years for the club, engaged in a public battle with Bayern's management and directors, trying to force his way out.  After weeks of denying any intentions to sell the Poland striker, the German giants gave the green light for Lewandowski's move to Barcelona. Their reluctance seemed justified, given that Lewandowski had been a life insurance for Bayern for quite some time. The expectation was that the loss of such a prolific goalscorer would diminish the Bundesliga champions' attacking power significantly - until Bayern played their first competitive match of the new season. They met RB Leipzig in the domestic Super Cup game in July. Leipzig, who on paper have one of the strongest squads in the Bundesliga, were obliterated in their own stadium in the first half. Bayern led the game 3-0 and showcased a new style. Without Lewandowski, their attack looked more unpredictable than ever as manager Julian Nagelsmann returned to the fast-paced football he made his name for at TSG Hoffenheim. He chose a 4-2-2-2 formation, giving up on the idea of focusing on one target striker. The narrow formation allows them to play vertical passes between four pairs: the centre halves, the centre midfielders, the attacking midfielders and the strikers.   Bayern start their Champions League campaign at Inter Milan on Wednesday sitting just third in the Bundesliga but can they still mix it with the elite in the absence of Lewandowski? While Nagelsmann should be applauded for coming up with a plan that would negate the necessity of a Lewandowski-like target man, he would not have much success without the technical precision and mental quickness of his key players. In light of the inevitable Lewandowski departure, Bayern's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic entered the transfer market to acquire two new key figures in Sadio Mane and Mathijs de Ligt.  In addition, the two Ajax graduates Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui were signed in the early days of the summer, while 17-year-old forward prospect Mathys Tel moved from Stade Rennes to Munich late in the transfer window.  Salihamdzic was also able to clean up the squad, selling players such as Marc Roca and Omar Richards who had no future at Bayern.  What remains is a group of 23 players that look stronger than when Lewandowski was still around. Mane was expected to take the Pole's place in the line-up, and to an extent he has. But Mane is not a traditional target man, even if he is able to play the central role in a forward line.  Nagelsmann counts on the Senegal forward's positional understanding and his ability to drift between the lines, as he is employed in his two-man attack. The former Liverpool player has scored five goals in seven games so far this season. He needed no time to acclimatise in Munich. His arrival was certainly made easier by those around him also stepping up their game. Most notably, Jamal Musiala has very quickly become a crucial piece of this Bayern side.  The 19-year-old German international is perfectly made for Nagelsmann's system because he thrives in tight areas and is able to defend the ball even against two or three markers.  It goes without saying that Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane, Kingsley Coman and Joshua Kimmich also thrive in direct and face-paced football. They have proven that already, particularly under head coach Hansi Flick when Bayern won the Champions League in 2020. Expectations rose after Bayern started the season scoring 20 goals in their first four games, including six against Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt. Many in Germany felt that no other side could realistically challenge them and deny them their 11th domestic championship in a row. But they have hit a few roadblocks recently.  First, they only drew with Borussia Monchengladbach at home, though the main reason for that outcome was an superb performance by Borussia goalkeeper Yann Sommer who made 19 saves, marking a new league record.  While that draw looked like a freak accident, Bayern also only drew 1-1 against Union Berlin  last Saturday.  Union, arguably the most capable defensive side in the Bundesliga, laid out a blueprint for how to neutralise Bayern. They employed a narrow high press, closing down the passing lanes for vertical balls and putting pressure on Bayern's centre halves. Union intended to eliminate any unpredictability by forcing Bayern to the wings where Coman or Sane would engage in one-on-ones which could be defended more easily than any quick pass combination. Mane was isolated up front and did not drop back into midfield to interact with his teammates as often as in previous games.  Nagelsmann has been confident that his team are able to break through tight defences. \"To lay bricks against us is normal,\" he said. \"But we will tear holes against deep-sitting opponents, too.\"  Union, however, presented a new problem in that they pressed higher up the pitch than others.  It is safe to say that Bayern's domestic rivals and their three opponents in Champions League group C have taken note and may even try to copy Union's defensive approach. Now it is up to Nagelsmann and his players to use this experience and refine their style even further. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62807971"},
{"title": "Real Madrid 3-1 Paris St-Germain (3-2 agg): Karim Benzema hat-trick inspires superb Real fightback", "content": "656 Karim Benzema scored a superb second-half hat-trick as Real Madrid produced a stirring fightback at a raucous Bernabeu to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris St-Germain.  Kylian Mbappe's first-half goal had given PSG a deserved two-goal aggregate lead and looked to have put Mauricio Pochettino's side well on course for the last eight.  However, a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma proved the catalyst for a dramatic recovery with Benzema turning home after the Italian dawdled in possession.  Luka Modric's driving run and intricate pass made Benzema's second as he levelled the tie against a clearly panicked PSG, and as the visitors attempted to regroup the 34-year-old drove a low effort into the bottom right corner seconds after the restart to settle the tie. Until Donnarumma's error PSG had been in complete control.  Marco Verratti was slick and dominant in midfield, while Neymar and Lionel Messi worked themselves into some dangerous positions as the hosts struggled to contain their more fluent opponents. Mbappe in particular was electric, racing on to a pass from Neymar to open the scoring against the side he has been heavily tipped to join in the summer when his contract at PSG expires. Either side of that the 23-year-old tormented the Real defence, twice having goals correctly disallowed for offside but showing his predatory instincts nonetheless. A surge of acceleration also saw him burst past Real's Eder Militao and only a brilliant covering challenge from David Alaba prevented him from adding to his tally.  Mbappe's influence was such that he received warm applause from the home support as he got up after appearing to be hurt in a tackle, but the real damage to his and PSG's long-standing aspirations in the competition were still to come.  Benzema's 17-minute treble ensured PSG suffered another painful elimination from a competition that has become an obsession since they moved into Qatari ownership in 2011. And after reaching the final and semi-finals in consecutive seasons this feels like a considerable backwards step for a squad that has been expensively assembled but remains prone to monumental collapses in this competition. This felt every bit as shattering as  their 6-1 thrashing by Barcelona  in 2017, their  last-16 defeat by Manchester United  in 2019, and was even more remarkable given they had not lost a Champions League away game after leading at half-time since 2001. While PSG are runaway leaders in Ligue 1 and have been crowned French champions in seven of the past nine seasons, domestic success is not the barometer Pochettino will be judged by come the end of the season.  And alarmingly the Argentine and his stunned players were unable to provide any adequate response once the tide had turned in this contest.  Julian Draxler and Angel di Maria were only introduced once the Parisiens were chasing the game, and aside from a late Messi free-kick which dipped just over, they were unable to conjure a single clear-cut goalscoring opportunity as they meekly exited the tournament.

A nightmare first half obliterated hopes of a maiden win in the Dutch capital to mark the end of a 12-year absence from Europe's top tournament. Instead, the Europa League runners-up were outclassed thanks to goals from Edson Alvarez, Steven Berghuis, Mohammed Kudus and Steven Bergwijn. Borna Barisic's second-half strike was ruled out by VAR to top a grim night. The defeat is Rangers' second 4-0 defeat in the space of a week after their Old Firm slump at Celtic Park on Saturday. On the eve of battle, manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst did not flinch. The Dutchman fielded questions about potentially changing elements of his team after Saturday's Celtic drubbing. Most notably goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin. \"You keep trusting your players and give them confidence because in the past we have bounced back from heavy defeats and that's what we have to do tomorrow as well,\" he said.

Then the floodgates opened on a torrid night. Just moments after a reticent Ryan Kent ducked out of a great counter-attack opportunity, the ball was in the Rangers net. A corner should have been dealt with. Instead Alvarez made a two-step move to evade a sleeping James Sands and head in. The waves of red and white attacks kept crashing against an increasingly nervous and sluggish Rangers defence. Devyne Rensch had one effort saved and watched another fly wide, before the second goal arrived just after the half hour. Berghuis found room on the edge of the Rangers box to shape up a shot. His effort looked as if it was going to be dealt with by the diving McLaughlin, only for a heavy Sands deflection to divert it away from the goalkeeper. Ajax's F-Side Ultras in the stands were still in full party mode when Kudus crashed in the third, but it was oh so easy.  His close control and spin caught James Tavernier napping, with the Rangers captain failing to make a convincing job of stopping the Ghanaian galloping forward and skelping a thunderous shot across McLaughlin and in off the upright. Van Bronckhorst made three substitutes at half-time, including removing Tavernier, but it took until 20 minutes before the end before Rangers mustered much of a reaction.  Kent's cutback for Barisic opened the defender up to arc a sumptuous strike into the far corner, but after a lengthy VAR check, it was clear Kent was a good few yards offside in the build-up.  But the night would get even worse, Bergwijn pouncing on a ropey Ryan Jack backpass to round McLaughlin and finish. It is easy to point at Rangers' static defending. As it is to heap praise on a patient Ajax who tied their opponents in knots with intricate triangles, off the ball running and more dropped shoulders than you could shake a stick at. But the mantra \"defending starts from the front\" springs to mind. And Rangers simply were not at it. Antonio Colak, the Ibrox side's focal point up front, barely touched the ball. Malik Tillman tried but got little support before his removal at the break.  Kent cut a frustrated figure on the left and it's clear to see why with just one goal this calendar year. There were brief flashes late on, but Rangers need more from him. This team have proven they can dazzle in Europe against clubs of this calibre, and Van Bronckhorst spoke about no knee-jerk reactions pre-match. But with back-to-back 4-0 defeats, a reaction is needed quickly to justify the trust he has put in his team. \"Eight goals in two games is too much for Rangers - that can never happen. The opponent can be strong, you can lose a game, but not the way we gifted the goals. \"Sometimes in football, you taste victory and success, and sometimes you taste defeat and feel low. When I have those moments in my career, those are the moments I wanted to fight even more. That's what I expect from my players as well.\" \"I'm buzzing, but it's a weird feeling. It wasn't easy for us we just executed at the right times. There's still work that can be done for us to get better and we're pleased with the performance.\" Rangers travel to Pittodrie on Saturday (13:00 BST) to face Aberdeen, with their next Champions League game coming at Ibrox against Napoli on 13 September.

{"title": "Rangers 0-3 Napoli: Serie A leaders claim victory against 10-man hosts", "content": "Ten-man Rangers fell to their third consecutive heavy defeat without scoring despite a more encouraging performance against Napoli on a dramatic night in the Champions League. Matteo Politano's penalty and late strikes from Giacomo Raspadori and Tanguy Ndombele secured victory, but only after Allan McGregor twice denied Piotr Zielinski from the spot. James Sands was sent off for conceding the first penalty and, though McGregor saved twice following a VAR check for encroachment, he did not deny Politano. The Italian forward put the ball low into the corner beyond the reach of the 40-year-old Rangers keeper after Borna Barisic was penalised for handball. Substitute Raspadori finished neatly with five minutes left to end the home side's challenge before Ndombele stroked another goal home in stoppage time against a tiring Rangers backline. Victory means Napoli top Group A with maximum points after two games, with Rangers winless ahead of back-to-back meetings with Liverpool next. Those matches will prove another stern test for Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side, but this performance will provide more hope than their recent 4-0 defeats at the hands of Ajax and Celtic, despite the scoreline.  Until going down to 10 men, this was much more like the Rangers of last season's Europa League, as they played with more energy from the start, after an emotionally-charged Ibrox paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth before kick-off. Alfredo Morelos - starting for the first time since March - headed over after just 35 seconds as Rangers hunted Napoli high up the pitch. Scott Arfield forced a fine save from Alex Meret before the break and Connor Goldson went close shortly after the interval with a header. Even as Napoli continued to threaten, McGregor - returning to the team due to Jon McLaughlin's injury - was set to become the hero again when he denied Zielinski after Sands felled Giovanni Simeone in the box when he was clean through. Politano swept in the rebound, but was judged to have encroached after a lengthy VAR check. That meant Zielenski stepped up again, but the Pole found no more joy the second time round as he went for the same corner. But Napoli - who also created plenty of chances before eventually breaking the deadlock - kept coming and Politano got his goal when Barisic's outstretched arm blocked a goal-bound shot, resulting in another penalty. From there, Rangers struggled as Napoli used the strength of their bench to kill the match.  Raspadori only needed a sniff in the box to lash beyond McGregor, while Ndombele was imposing and swept home nicely after a tidy lay off from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa. It was another brutal lesson for Rangers against a top-quality team, as if they needed it following a difficult opening match in Amsterdam and with back-to-back games with Liverpool to come. After a difficult fortnight, Rangers manager Van Bronckhorst got the response he would have wanted from kick-off, as his side turned in a much better performance. Morelos, despite lacking sharpness, was much more of a handful for Napoli's centre-backs when the ball wasn't in the box, and he allowed Rangers to attack from deep and cause problems.  The team were applauded off vociferously at half-time, a signal of their improvement. But as is always the case at this level, if you don't take your chances and switch off for a few seconds, you get punished. Sands' desperation to stop Simeone ended in the harshest punishment, as Napoli took advantage despite McGregor's attempts. With Liverpool home and away to come, qualification looks a tall order. But at least there is something to build on for Rangers, despite another chastening scoreline.  \"Until the red card we gave Napoli a really tough game. We were organised, good in the game and players were giving everything to get a good result. \"The first goal we conceded made me change the way we were playing because we need to attack and you know you are going to get more space, so in the end I think the 3-0 defeat did not reflect the difference in quality.\"  \"They started really strong with their fans as we expected but instead of shrinking we reacted. \"\"After two missed penalties it was important that we kept going. I thought it was a balanced game at a lot of points but we didn't change, we never stopped pressing them and I want to thank everybody.\" Rangers are at home to Dundee United in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST).

{"title": "Bayern Munich 5-0 Viktoria Plzen: Bundesliga champions continue perfect European start", "content": "27 Bayern Munich continued their perfect start to Champions League Group C with a routine win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen. Leroy Sane, Serge Gnabry and Sadio Mane all scored within the first 21 minutes to ease the Bundesliga champions to victory. Sane made it four just after half-time before Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting completed the rout. The win leaves Bayern with the maximum nine points from their opening games. Their preparations for this game were disrupted when Joshua Kimmich and Thomas Muller were ruled out with Covid, and Bayern had just five outfield players on the bench. However any nerves were settled after just seven minutes by a superb goal from Sane. The winger started the move from the centre circle, playing a one-two with Jamal Musiala before driving to the edge of the area and firing the ball into the roof of the net. Six minutes later, Bayern caught Plzen on the counter attack with Goretzka carrying the ball through the centre of midfield before laying off to Gnabry who slotted home off the inside of the post. Any slight doubts about the outcome were settled on 21 minutes. Mane got a fortunate deflection off a defender in the build-up, however it was his pace and anticipation which saw him race onto the loose ball before scoring at the near post. Musiala then had a goal ruled out for offside, but it was soon 4-0 just after the break when Sane raced onto a lofted through ball from Mane, controlled it with the outside of his left foot and struck it past Plzen goalkeeper Marian Tvrdon. The strike took Sane's goal tally to four in three Champions League fixtures. Before the hour it was five for Bayern, Goretzka again the provider from midfield with a through ball that Choupo-Moting, newly on as a substitute, curled in via the post from 15 yards. Bayern continue to underwhelm domestically - Julian Nagelsmann's side sit third in the Bundesliga, behind surprise pacemakers Union Berlin and Freiburg. However in Europe, from what looked a difficult group also featuring Barcelona and Inter Milan, they are living up to their billing as one of the tournament favourites.

{"title": "Man City 5-0 Copenhagen: Pep Guardiola dismisses Erling Haaland release clause rumours as 'not true'", "content": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says reports in Spain that Erling Haaland's contract contains a special release clause for him to join Real Madrid in 2024 are \"not true\". Speaking after the 22-year-old Norway striker had continued his incredible start at City by  hitting two goals against Copenhagen  in the Champions League, Guardiola denied rumours that Madrid have engineered an exclusive agreement to sign him. \"It's not true,\" Guardiola said. \"He has not got a release clause for Real Madrid, or any other team. \"Am I annoyed by the rumours? No, absolutely not. Rumours, and people talking, you cannot control it - so always we have to worry about what we can control. \"The important thing is that he has adapted [since joining City] really well. I have the feeling he is incredibly happy here, and this is the most important thing.\" It is hardly surprising to see Haaland linked with the Spanish giants given his phenomenal form for City - he has now scored 19 goals in his first 12 games since joining from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. His display in Wednesday's one-sided 5-0 win over the Danish side was the latest demonstration of his awesome scoring power, with even team-mate Jack Grealish left stunned by Haaland's performance. \"It's unbelievable, honestly,\" Grealish told BT Sport. \"I've never witnessed anything like it in my life. For the first and second goals, I was just laughing. He is always there. \"Their keeper said something to me as I was walking back. He said 'he's not human!' I said 'you're telling me?' Hopefully he can carry on this form and take us to glory.\" If not for Copenhagen keeper Kamil Grabara, Haaland would have had even more goals to celebrate. Haaland beat him with his first touch of the game to open the scoring - a precise finish from a Joao Cancelo cross - but saw his next two efforts - a towering header and powerful strike on the turn - brilliantly stopped. Typically, that did not deter him, and he was in the right place to tap into an empty net to make it 2-0 after Sergio Gomez's long-range shot was saved. That left Haaland needing only one more goal to complete his fourth hat-trick in six home games for City, but Guardiola played the party pooper by taking him off at half-time. Guardiola said that substituting his star striker was not always the plan but, with the game won, his focus switched to Saturday's home game with Southampton. Haaland agreed with the decision - that next hat-trick can wait. \"I've got to be honest with you, with Erling what he wants is the same is the same as all of us, which is to win games,\" Guardiola explained. \"When he made those hat-tricks, it was to win the games. Of course if he played 45 more minutes, he would get more chances but he has played a lot of minutes, it was 3-0 and the game was under control. \"If the game was tight then Erling would continue to play but it was better to rest and think of Southampton, a team we were not able to beat last season. Hopefully this season we can do it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63153172"},
{"title": "Chelsea 3-0 AC Milan: Reece James' quality and class reduced to footnote in England defender debate", "content": "676 The quality and class of Chelsea's Reece James has sometimes been reduced to a footnote in the fevered debate surrounding the England status of Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold.  Alexander-Arnold is a rare talent, no-one can make any argument against this, as he proved again with his superb free-kick in Liverpool's Champions League win against Rangers at Anfield on Tuesday.  England manager Gareth Southgate, however, clearly prefers the all-round game of 22-year-old James as first-choice right back and he delivered such a complete performance in Chelsea's 3-0 victory over AC Milan at Stamford Bridge that it was difficult to argue with that logic.  Alexander-Arnold's goal against Rangers added more fuel to a debate that will rage until Southgate names his squad for the World Cup in Qatar - and probably beyond if he is named in the travelling party.  The argument against Alexander-Arnold is his vulnerability as a defender, which has been seen this season. Events, including his goal against Rangers, did not tell us anything about him that we did not already know.  No matter what nuances are brought into the debate, it seems a very simple situation.  In his opinion, Southgate believes James - and indeed Manchester City's Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier of Newcastle United - offers him more solidity and tactical flexibility than Alexander-Arnold.  This not to decry Alexander-Arnold here or suggest he should not even be in the World Cup squad but equally it is very difficult to make any sort of strong case that he should displace James, as proved by his powerhouse performance as Milan were well beaten.  Alexander-Arnold's supporters will continue to press his claims but James is the player in possession. He has been in better form in recent months and provides a rounded range of attributes that simply cannot be ignored.  Southgate knows this one will run and run but it does appear his mind is made up and it is not as if James represents an inferior alternative. He deserves his place in England's team and has done nothing to lose it.  James and Alexander-Arnold may well end up both going to Qatar but there is no doubt who is at the forefront of Southgate's thoughts.  There has been talk of shoehorning Alexander-Arnold into England's team as an auxiliary midfield player but this would be a punt and it is too late for further experimentation of this nature with the World Cup six weeks away. Southgate has made James his pick and for all the noise around this preference over Alexander-Arnold, England's manager has every right to be comfortable with his decision based on current form.  James took the man of the match award at Stamford Bridge and rightly so for his starring role as Chelsea took the game by the scruff of the neck in the second half.  Chelsea were leading by Wesley Fofana's goal when James made his crucial interventions, providing a perfect cross for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when he added the second after 56 minutes.  He was on target himself five minutes later, finding space on the angle in the area, having the confidence and composure to thrash an unstoppable finish high past Milan keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post.  Alexander-Arnold's attacking assets are rightly acknowledged but anyone who ignores what James can offer in this department, as he showed here, is dismissing a big part of his game and doing him a disservice.  Stamford Bridge rejoiced as they noisily acclaimed \"one of our own\", a smiling James taking the applause on a lap of honour after the final whistle.  James was an integral part of what was a statement win for Graham Potter, the sort any new manager craves to show they mean business after taking on the unique beast that is Chelsea.  This was convincing, albeit against a Milan side with key absentees, and the delight of Potter was clear to see.  Aubameyang showed he still possesses that predator's touch that makes him so potent. Chelsea may be the beneficiaries of a striker with something to prove in London after he came back to the capital from Barcelona following his exile at Arsenal.  James is rock solid at Chelsea, a home-grown talent with a contract that runs to 2028. He is a key element of this often turbulent club's long-term future.  England manager Southgate is fortunate to have James at his disposal. He is fortunate to have the ability to call on Alexander-Arnold.  However, he got all the evidence he needs at Stamford Bridge to present as 'Exhibit A' in his case for James as his England right-back in Qatar.

{"title": "Chelsea 3-0 AC Milan: Blues produce emphatic and deserved win over Serie A giants", "content": "434 Chelsea's Champions League campaign kicked into gear with an emphatic and fully deserved win over AC Milan at Stamford Bridge. New manager Graham Potter knew victory was essential after a poor start to their group phase with defeat away by Dinamo Zagreb finishing Thomas Tuchel's reign before a draw at home to Red Bull Salzburg. And Chelsea delivered in style, with England right-back Reece James the star man as they eventually overpowered Milan. Wesley Fofana scored his first goal for the club after 24 minutes when Milan failed to clear a corner, although the £70m defender's night was soon ended by injury.  The Italians almost equalised right on half-time when Rade Krunic fired over with the goal at his mercy. It was a rare anxious moment and the second half belonged to Chelsea, and James in particular, the right-back demonstrating why he commands such faith at club level and from England manager Gareth Southgate. James was the provider after 56 minutes when he crossed for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to apply a simple finish, then he was the finisher five minutes later with a powerful strike which flew high past Milan keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post. Potter will be delighted with the manner of this important win, not only because it gave Chelsea the three points they needed to boost their chances of reaching the Champions League knockout stage, but it was also just the sort of victory and performance any new manager wants early in their reign. Chelsea stuttered against Salzburg and Potter admitted they rode their luck to beat Crystal Palace on Saturday but was this a comprehensive triumph over a Milan side that rarely threatened, apart from when the pacy and talented Rafael Leao was in possession, carving out the clear chance which Krunic somehow missed on the stroke of half-time. Otherwise, this was a tale of Chelsea domination, the night only clouded by that injury to Fofana that Potter will hope does not prove serious. After Fofana's opening goal, it was left to James to demonstrate exactly why England manager Southgate is prepared to ignore the lobby for Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold to get a place in the England team at right-back. James is close to the complete defender, solid in defence and also potent in attack here, making Aubameyang's job easy for Chelsea's second then crashing in the third himself. James goes about his business quietly but ability, power and attitude make him a formidable proposition. Aubameyang may have been taken aback when Tuchel, the manager who worked with him at Borussia Dortmund and was central to his arrival at Chelsea from Barcelona, was sacked shortly after his return. Chelsea and Potter moved to reassure the striker about his situation and he is starting to prove exactly why they were so keen to bring him back from Catalonia, where he moved after he was exiled at Arsenal. He showed his expertise with a goal in the win at Crystal Palace and demonstrated his poacher's instinct here with an instinctive finish from James' cross. Aubameyang will be a serious weapon for Potter and Chelsea if he regains top form and he looks in the mood to enjoy his career at Stamford Bridge.

{"title": "Rangers v Liverpool: Antonio Colak has made compelling case for Champions League start", "content": "Antonio Colak or Alfredo Morelos? The question was one put to several Rangers supporters outside Anfield before last week's Champions League defeat by Liverpool.  And despite Colak's significant goal return, a slight majority favoured Morelos. Giovannni van Bronckhorst, the Ibrox manager, opted for the Colombian, too, with the Croat introduced from the bench later in the 2-0 loss. Morelos' record in Europe - or, at least, in the Europa League - is impressive. His inclusion last week might have been based on that and the idea that he might ruffle Liverpool's apparently fragile back line. He didn't, ultimately. In his defence, he barely got a sniff. However, Colak's case to start on Wednesday when the Premier League side visit Ibrox has become compelling. Thirteen goals in 16 games. Ten in nine in the Scottish Premiership. Six in his last three in the league. The 29-year-old's confidence must be sky high and surely that's exactly what Rangers need after a bruising experience across their opening three Champions League fixtures? It was Colak's goal in Eindhoven that delivered Champions League football. He scored in the first leg, too. He's also got a point to prove now. Form and hunger could be a potent combination. The striker, signed from PAOK in the summer, has played eight competitive games at Ibrox. Only once has he failed score - against Napoli in a game that Rangers competed in until being reduced to 10-men after an hour. In those Govan games, Colak's goals return is 10. Impressive stats. He seems to thrive in that atmosphere and the Ibrox cauldron is one that Rangers have generally revelled in on the European stage. A marriage made in heaven? \"I don't think he's guaranteed to start but it would be very, very hard to leave him out now,\" said former Ibrox forward Kenny Miller on Sportscene.  \"When you're right at the top of your game - and he is at the moment - things happen for you. He's been absolutely ruthless of late, anticipating where the ball is going to go, and scoring big goals. He's been a breath of fresh air.\" Stats aren't everything, just as goals aren't either, even for strikers. Colak has a high work rate and scores different types of goals, as evidenced by his brace against St Mirren on Saturday. One came from anticipating an opportunity from close range, the other from cutting inside to create an angle and showing subtlety and confidence to curl the ball home with the outside of the foot. It hasn't gone unnoticed by his Van Bronckhorst, who spoke of Colak being \"on fire in the league\". \"I always look at what the game what the game needs, what we need from the game,\" the manager added. \"If we want to continue our run in Europe, we need points, so that means you have to have a different approach, a positive one.\" Compare this with Morelos. Just two league goals this term. An unnecessary red card in a draw with Hibernian. Fitness and attitude concerns that saw him left behind for that crucial qualifier against PSV. He seems to have knuckled down to a degree after the indignity of it all but, pound for pound, who would you back right now? Morelos or Colak? Remarkably, the former has started only twice this season. But those two games were against Napoli and Liverpool, so he has been backed to deliver on the biggest stage by his manager, even though his minutes have been as limited as his impact.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63193412"},

Jurgen Klopp's side have struggled for form this season but a disappointing Scottish team represented the perfect opposition to return to winning ways as Liverpool moved closer to a place in the knockout phase. Rangers fans travelled to Merseyside in their thousands and backed their side noisily throughout an embarrassingly one-sided encounter which Liverpool should have won far more emphatically. Trent Alexander-Arnold put Liverpool ahead after only seven minutes when he clipped a perfect 25-yard free-kick into the top corner and only veteran keeper Allan McGregor kept the Rangers in range with a succession of saves, frustrating Darwin Nunez in particular. Liverpool finally got the second goal they deserved eight minutes after the break when Mohamed Salah scored from the penalty spot after Leon King fouled Luis Diaz. Rangers, who have not won a point from three games in Group A, had a late chance when Kostas Tsimikas cleared off the line from Rabbi Matondo but they were outclassed by a Liverpool side who did not need to hit top gear to win. The build-up to this Champions League confrontation contained the usual 'Battle Of Britain' narrative as Rangers travelled south of the border to Anfield to test their credentials against one of the Premier League elite. In reality, this was over as a contest once Alexander-Arnold demonstrated perfect technique to curl his free-kick beyond McGregor. Liverpool never looked back and Rangers never mounted a serious threat. Liverpool's only disappointment was that they did not make the most of the host of chances they created, with the hard-working Nunez hitting the target with most of his efforts and showing good movement, only to put his finishes too close to McGregor on too many occasions. For all their domination, Liverpool relied on a brilliant free-kick and a penalty to secure the win. It was the ideal game for them to gain some rhythm and momentum, with Klopp selecting an all-out attacking line-up with a front four of Salah, Nunez, Diaz and Diogo Jota. They will surely face a tougher test at a hostile Ibrox in the return game but this simply could not have been more comfortable, making it a satisfactory night for Klopp, who wanted to see Liverpool edging somewhere back towards their best. The win also leaves Liverpool well placed to reach the knockout stage, sitting second with six points from three games and a three-point lead over third-placed Ajax,  who lost 6-1 at home to Napoli . Rangers appeared to be mounting little more than a damage limitation exercise once they lost an early goal, the gulf in class between the two sides immediately apparent and not reflected in final scoreline. They did not pose any sort of threat until it was too late, with that Tsimikas clearance and an Alisson block from Antonio Colak providing a very rare anxious moment for Liverpool.  For the rest of the game Rangers could not get near Liverpool and were grateful to McGregor, who earned warm applause from the Kop for preventing a heavier defeat. The 40-year-old keeper showed his enduring ability as he delivered as fine performance to deny Nunez on several occasions as Liverpool's big-money summer signing strived to get on the scoresheet. Ryan Kent and Alfredo Morelos made no impact on Liverpool's defence, who had a comfortable night, although to say they were short of supply is a masterpiece of under-statement. Rangers must hope they can present a different proposition to Liverpool when they visit what is sure to be a hostile Ibrox, as Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side try to claim as least some consolation from a Champions League campaign which has so far proved such a struggle.

{"title": "Rangers 1-7 Liverpool: Big dog barks louder as Ibrox growl falls silent", "content": "A night when the record books are lifted from dusty shelves in search of information about Rangers' biggest ever European hidings.  There's been some whoppers. Some fours, some fives, a few sixes. Never in all their time has there been a seven, but here it was, started by Roberto Firmino and finished with a surgeon's precision by Mohamed Salah. The great man came off the bench and in six minutes 12 seconds he scored a hat-trick. Don't bother trying to find a speedier treble in the history of this competition - there hasn't been one. Salah tormented Rangers.  Long before the end, the home side were sitting ducks - no offence to sitting ducks - in the face of a Liverpool team who were taking immense joy in taking the frustrations of their league season out on Giovanni van Bronckhorst's beleaguered crew. As if losing 7-1 wasn't bad enough, there was the pitiful sight at the end of a pocket of their fans running to the away corner and firing missiles at Liverpool supporters who were being held behind. Cowardly doesn't even come close. If you thought the action on the field was cringe-making from a Rangers perspective, those moments were even worse. The reality of life in the Champions League has been hard on Rangers, existing as they are in the group of certain death for a club of their lightweight financial muscle. Underdogs can occasionally roar, though. The problem is that the big dogs roar louder, more often than not.  Rangers hadn't scored in three Champions League games. They'd only had six shots on target. They didn't have a sniff at Anfield until it was 2-0 and too late. But here, in front of their own people, they found something, if only for a little while.  In that opening half, Rangers were everything they weren't at Anfield a week ago - aggressive, ambitious and accurate.  They took the lead because James Tavernier jumped all over Fabio Carvalho and robbed him of possession, because Antonio Colak was decisive with his lay-off, and because Ryan Jack played a pin-sharp pass through the visitors' defence. Scott Arfield had a bit to do, but his finish was perfect. Ibrox erupted in that moment. The question for Liverpool was clear - would they feel sorry for themselves or, amid the maelstrom, would they rouse themselves? Jurgen Klopp had made six changes - resting some of his heavy hitters for Manchester City at the weekend - but the concession of the first goal was wearily familiar.  Mid-table after their worst start in a decade. Fourteen points behind Arsenal and 13 behind Manchester City. A battery of injuries and a leaky defence. And now trailing against a side with the bit between their teeth and 50,000 fans lustily roaring their approval. What could they find? Quite a lot as it turned out. A goal mountain.  The equaliser was a moment to make Rangers wince, a corner to the front post and a simple header for Firmino. James Tavernier might have been beside him, but the Rangers captain wasn't exactly making his presence be known. It was beyond soft.  From then on, it was the Liverpool show. The Firmino show, the Darwin Nunez show, but above all the Salah show.  Firmino scored Liverpool's second, then Nunez made it three. There was a back story to that one. Allan McGregor had repeatedly denied the big striker last week, but the goalkeeper was at fault for once here. His poor kick-out was seized on, Firmino beautifully set up Nunez, and Liverpool had three. We were just beyond the hour and Salah was entering the fray. The noise that could be heard around Ibrox was the sound of tens of thousands of people gulping hard.  He moved with a menace and a class the like of which Rangers have not seen in this place for a very long time. What started as a solid performance soon became a record-busting embarrassment. Salah, with the fastest hat-trick in Champions League history, ran amok. Seven minutes and three goals. It was almost obscene.  Salah has not been his world class best of late. Before this thunderous return to form, his goals tally was a third of his number at this stage of last season. You can bank on death and taxes in this world. You can also add Salah finding his mojo to that list of certainties.  Seventy-five minutes: brilliant control, a movement away from Borna Barisic and a finish past McGregor. Eighty minutes: one-touch passes bamboozling a bewildered defence and a time-stands-still moment as Salah stopped, measured the goal for size and put his shot away. Eighty-two minutes: Salah hypnotising Barisic before making it six for his team. Mesmeric. Harvey Elliott made it seven and thereby put this one into the annals of Ibrox history - the bad history, that is. The dark stuff.  We don't know what this will do to Rangers' season or what it will do for Liverpool, but there was a jaw-dropping aspect to that six-goal second half. Every Rangers fan exited in a daze, in silence and with blank expressions. Every Liverpool fan won't get carried away, but it was an important night, a night when the feelgood returned. Who knows where it might take them.  For Liverpool, it's all about City on Sunday and a chance to land a blow. For Rangers, the recriminations are coming. In Glasgow, the post-mortems tend to be brutal and lengthy. This one will last awhile.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63237460"},
{"title": "Champions League: Spurs duo Kane & Son 'just understand each other'", "content": "460 When Son Heung-min or Harry Kane score, the other is usually involved.  It is a combination we have got used to seeing and the pair linked up again for the 50th time in all competitions as  Tottenham beat Frankfurt 3-2  to go top of their Champions League group. \"We just understand each other really well,\" South Korea star Son told BT Sport afterwards, as his double helped Tottenham edge closer to qualification for the knockout stages.  Kane set up Son's equaliser after Frankfurt had taken an early lead, before the 29-year-old England captain scored from the penalty spot.  Son, 30, went on to score a thumping volley in the second half, and despite Kane missing another penalty in stoppage time, both were otherwise on top form at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \"I know what [Kane] likes to do and he's the same. The relationship has always been a pay-off for hard work. Many more [goals] to come I hope,\" added Son. Since the start of last season, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (39) is the only Premier League player with more goals in all competitions than Kane (36) and Son (29). Tottenham have had a two-year absence from the Champions League and have not hit the heights they once did in Europe under former manager Mauricio Pochettino. Since their defeat by Liverpool in the 2018-19 final, Spurs have failed to go beyond the last 16 in the Champions League or the Europa League and were knocked out in the group stages of the Europa Conference League last season. However, their fluent attacking display on Wednesday provides hope they could go further in Europe under manager Antonio Conte. German football expert Raphael Honigstein said \"Spurs are back\" after their performance because \"they come alive when they go forward\". \"That combination between Son and Kane is incredible,\" he added. \"Son is playing with real confidence and that is a testament to how Spurs have adapted to Antonio Conte's style of football. They are unstoppable like this.\" It has not always been smooth for Son this season as the South Korean fired blanks in his first six games after netting 23 goals in 2021-22. Son was even dropped to the bench for their Premier League game against Leicester City but he responded by  netting a 13-minute hat-trick  as a substitute. \"Son's had his critics this season but he's answering them. He looked really in the mood,\" former Tottenham striker Peter Crouch said on BT Sport after Spurs' victory over Frankfurt. Former Spurs manager Glenn Hoddle added: \"Forget what was going on in the earlier part of the season, Son was looking sharp and he's getting there.  \"It gives him that confidence that he has been looking for. His technique [for the volley] was fantastic and we were all thinking he'd go on to get his hat-trick.\" Son's stunning volley to put Spurs 3-1 ahead capped off an impressive performance and he was given a standing ovation when he came off late in the second half.  Kane was also praised for his hold-up play, while Richarlison worked tirelessly to create space for his attacking team-mates. And former England midfielder Owen Hargreaves believes Tottenham will continue to cause teams problems in the competition because of their threat up front. \"These guys are so good. You trust them to go and do the job,\" he told BT Sport. \"Son is the best finisher with his weaker foot in the world of football. He could not have hit that volley any sweeter. He can score fabulous goals.\" Spurs were on course for a routine win, leading 3-1, until Faride Alidou gave Frankfurt hope before Kane uncharacteristically missed a penalty to kill the game at the death. \"The negative aspect is the final part and it has to be a big lesson for everybody, for me, for the players,\" said Conte. \"The game finishes when the referee whistles three times. \"In the last part of the game, everybody conceded the game ended and for this reason we made a big mistake. We conceded a corner they scored, then we had the opportunity to score the penalty but we missed the penalty. \"When we missed the penalty honestly, I was a bit scared, because I thought everything can happen. \"It is difficult, now we are talking with a smile because we won. But imagine if this game finished a draw. That would have been a disaster.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63236898"},

They raced into a two-goal lead as Hirving Lozano sent a looping header into the far corner and Giacomo Raspadori thumped a left-footed drive into the roof of the net.  Ex-Everton man Davy Klaasen's header reduced Ajax's arrears after the break, before Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's penalty, harshly awarded for handball against Jurrien Timber after a Video Assistant Referee review, extended Napoli's lead back to two goals. The visitors were then given a late penalty when Juan Jesus was adjudged to have fouled Brian Brobbey, with former Tottenham forward Steven Bergwijn converting to cause a nervy finale.  However, those nerves were settled when Victor Osimhen harried Daley Blind into a mistake and tapped into the empty net for his first Champions League goal of the season.  The result leaves Napoli, who have now scored 17 goals in their four group games, in pole position to top group A, at the expense of Liverpool.

{"title": "Rangers 1-7 Liverpool: Anfield side humiliate Scots in Champions League", "content": "2623 Mohamed Salah came off the bench to score an incredible six-minute hat-trick as Liverpool obliterated Rangers in the Champions League.  The striker netted three times in his sensational first 13 minutes on the pitch to silence a once-euphoric Ibrox crowd. Scott Arfield had given Rangers an early lead with their first group goal, but a Roberto Firmino double and a Darwin Nunez strike set Liverpool on their way, with Harvey Elliott getting a seventh after a VAR check. It was a mesmeric second-half performance from the Premier League club, who now just need a draw against Ajax in Amsterdam in two weeks to advance to the next stage. A beleaguered Rangers are still searching for their first points, and their hopes turn to trying to finish third in Group A and claim a Europa League place. It does not get any easier for them, though, as they travel to face group leaders Napoli next. As Salah trotted on to the Ibrox pitch, it was with little fanfare. Nunez had just given the visitors a commanding 3-1 lead, and the Egyptian's introduction seemed almost like the cherry on the cake after a tasty game had been yanked away from Rangers. But a player whose stellar form has dipped to merely good this term produced something special - the fastest ever Champions League hat-trick. It started with an old-fashioned toe poke from a tight angle. Salah was off and running. A handful of minutes later, a drop of the shoulder, a quick change of pace on the edge of the box, and a deceptive finish brought his second. Ibrox, not for the first or last time in the half, fell silent. There was barely time to type his name as the player of the match before his astonishing intervention was complete with yet another composed finish. After just 17 minutes of this frenzied contest, it looked all so different. All of Liverpool's wins since August have come in Europe, but another looked unlikely amid a cacophony of noise in Govan.  A flowing Rangers move cleaved open a static Liverpool defence and allowed Arfield space to steer a shot low across Alisson and into the net. Finally Rangers had arrived in this year's Champions League. It was an arrival which was celebrated for seven minutes. Kostas Tsimikas' whipped corner to the near post found an unmarked and grateful Firmino, who nodded in from six yards.  Ten minutes after the break, Firmino hushed a raucous crowd again. Joe Gomez's rampaging run down the right created the opening, and his inch-perfect delivery found the Brazilian on the run for a low first-time steer through Allan McGregor's legs.  The writing was on the wall for Rangers by this point, and it was absolutely game over on 66 minutes. Again Firmino was involved, his cute flick teeing up Nunez for a curling shot around McGregor from the edge of the box for a goal met with a ferocious punch of the air by manager Jurgen Klopp. After Salah was finished stealing the show, there was still time for more as Elliott got in on the act. The youngster was originally flagged for offside after volleying in, before a VAR check reversed the decision and sent him jogging away in celebration to a jubilant band of supporters in the far corner. This was a result Liverpool needed, but the scoreline will send a warning that they are still capable of being imperious. Apart from Firmino's opener, they did not look clinical in front of goal in the first half. They were also playing themselves into trouble at the other end. But the Brazilian played a starring role in turning the tide. His link-up play was a joy to watch, while his finishing and influence was key as Liverpool ran riot after the break. Then enter Salah... Rangers, meanwhile, now sit bottom of Group A with a goal difference of minus 15 and zero points. The heat of Seville and the Europa League final has long since faded as a winter of discontent on the continent brews. There is still time for Giovanni van Bronckhorst's team to secure some sort of European football after Christmas, but there won't be too many inside Ibrox for this one who will have much hope of them doing so. \"We need to accept the criticism. It's part of my job, and part of the players' job. We have to take it on the chin. The whole locker room was quiet, because everyone feels the loss.  \"Sometimes when the emotions are very high it's better not to speak and pick it up tomorrow. We have to change our mentality. We can be very strong, but when we are not there mentally, our levels drop really quick.\" \"We had a really positive half-time talk. We wanted more in the second half. Clearly, it worked out. It's the best we could have asked for. I'm really pleased. \"The goals we scored were exceptional. it's a night where things worked out for us. It changes the mood.

{"title": "Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan: Xavi's side on brink of Champions League exit after draw", "content": "460 Barcelona are on the brink of a group-stage Champions League exit for the second successive season after being held to a draw by Inter Milan in a breathless and high-octane game at the Nou Camp.  Having been beaten in the San Siro last week, Xavi's side went into the game knowing that they realistically needed to win to maintain hope of progressing from Group C, with teams on the same points split by their head-to-head record. The draw leaves Inter - who sit second,  behind Bayern Munich who progressed on Wednesday  - three points ahead of Barcelona, with both to still play Bayern and Viktoria Plzen.  With Bayern already through, an Inter Milan home win on Wednesday, 26 October (17:45), against bottom side Viktoria Plzen will confirm Barca's elimination. Barcelona boss Xavi said: \"We're depending on another team to go through. They are our mistakes, we have to improve them. That's the reality. The [improvement] process is longer than we thought in Europe. \"There are other competitions, La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Super Copa. We have to insist, persist, believe. \"When you draw at home with these fans, with this atmosphere, it is my fault. I am angry. My feeling is that this competition has been, and is still being, cruel with us.\" Barcelona took the lead just before half-time when Raphinha did well to keep the ball in, before threading through for Sergi Roberto, who squared for Ousmane Dembele to tap home. It cued joyous and extravagant celebrations from boss Xavi and the whole Barcelona dugout but that soon turned to despair in the second half. Nicolo Barella latched onto an Alessandro Bastoni dinked ball and lashed into the roof of the net to pull Inter level, before Lautaro Martinez chested a right-wing cross from Hakan Calhanoglu inside Eric Garcia, with his effort hitting both posts before going over the line. It led to a cauldron of noise at the Nou Camp, and that pressure eventually told when Poland striker Robert Lewandowski saw a header fall back at his feet, and his deflected effort squeezed past Andre Onana.  From there the game descended into chaos. Inter took the lead again as Onana cleared quickly for Martinez, who squared for Robin Gosens to lash home and leave Barcelona out of the competition again.  However, that was not the end of the drama, as Lewandowski rose highest to meet Garcia's cross from the right and head past Onana and keep the hosts' hopes alive again. Inter then had two chances to win it on the break as Kristjan Asllani was put through but Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved with his legs, before Gosens saw a header saved.   Throughout the game, but particularly in the second half, Inter were able to cut through Barcelona at will. Gerard Pique came in at the heart of defence because of injuries, but he was at fault for Barella's goal, misjudging the flight of the ball, before Garcia was easily beaten for the second goal. The third goal came from one straight ball, and Martinez was able to cross along the entire width of the penalty area for Gosens to lash home. After the remarkable 92nd-minute equaliser from Lewandowski, Barca pushed forward, leaving large gaps for Inter to exploit. If Simone Inzaghi's side had been more clinical Barcelona would be out in the group stages for the second successive season, after a run of 17 years in the knockout stages. There were promising signs, with summer signing Raphinha impressing on the right, and Lewandowski again demonstrating the prolific scoring ability he's shown throughout his career, but their defensive issues against top-level sides will be of major concern to Xavi.  Barcelona won't have long to regroup either. They are unbeaten so far in La Liga and sit top but face Real Madrid - also unbeaten and separated from their rivals only by goal difference - on Sunday in the first El Clasico of the season. This will be a big disappointment because the financial situation is critical to the club and therefore so is advancing in the Champions League. It means many millions. It's now a big setback. I don't think he's [Xavi] under pressure but we have to know that the team is under construction. The team has talent but that talent is in their 20s or their 30s. The team lacks talent from the ages 25-29. We saw a fragile team in defence, with many missing defenders. The team is under construction and he wants time and for the younger players to gain experience. Lewandowski scored two goals but he's 35. In two years time, Barcelona will probably be a more reliable team. This group was very difficult. The Champions League pulls you to your limit and it's a very physical competition. A few months ago, we were saying they're a broken club. There's been big investment but not enough, they need more physical players in the Champions League. Maybe three or four more. They're not far off but they're either too young or too old to compete at this level reliably. Formation    4-3-3 Formation    3-5-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63221311"},

Frankfurt took an early lead when Eric Dier lost possession and Daichi Kamada was teed up to score from close range but Harry Kane set up Son for the equaliser six minutes later. England captain Kane then scored from the penalty spot and Son's thumping volley made it 3-1 before half-time. Frankfurt's Tuta was shown a second yellow card for bringing Son down early in the second half but Faride Alidou's header made it 3-2 with three minutes remaining to make for a nervous ending for Spurs. Kane missed a second penalty in stoppage time but Tottenham held on for a deserved win.  Tottenham looked back to their best at times and could have won by a greater margin, but sloppy mistakes kept Frankfurt in the game. The visitors largely struggled to deal with Spurs' attack but goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was forced to tip over an effort by Jesper Lindstrom and there was some desperate defending as Frankfurt had chances late on.  Antonio Conte's hosts threatened throughout with Son, Ryan Sessegnon, Richarlison and Cristian Romero among those to come close. It was a frantic finale but victory means Tottenham sit top of the group with two wins from four matches, while Frankfurt drop to the bottom of the table with four points.  Tottenham next host Sporting Lisbon on 26 October. Frankfurt dominated early on and pressed and harried Spurs, leading to a mistake from Dier and the opening goal from Kamada, who had already come close when just failing to connect with Lindstrom's curling cross.  But it did not take long for Tottenham to capitalise on the gaping spaces left in behind by Frankfurt. Kane and Son were on form, linking up fluently and causing havoc as Richarlison worked tirelessly to create space for his team-mates to run into.  The efficiency of Spurs' attacking line-up was too much for Frankfurt and it was only a matter of time before the hosts turned things around. Kane won and converted a penalty when he was bundled over in the box by Kristijan Jakic less than 10 minutes after he had set up Son for the equaliser.  Son, who came off to a standing ovation, capped off a superb performance with a thumping volley before half-time.  Kane and Son have now linked up 50 times to score for Tottenham in all competitions and Richarlison's addition to the squad has added further attacking threat.  The Brazilian almost set up Sessegnon with a brilliant curling cross early in the second half and was unfortunate not to score when he headed inches wide in the opening period. Tottenham should have finished with a comfortable victory but the late header from Alidou gave way a wild few minutes as Spurs substitute Bryan Gil missed a diving header, was then fouled in the box to earn a penalty and Kane uncharacteristically fired it over the bar.

Just nine weeks on from the raucous celebrations in Eindhoven and the giddy excitement of the following day's Champions League draw, Rangers have one more chance to spare themselves continental ignominy. All the hope and anticipation has been whittled away, exposing the grim reality of trying to compete with last season's runners-up Liverpool, an Ajax team who reached the last 16 and, in Napoli, a side that might well go on and claim the big shiny pot themselves this term. After five chastening losses, Rangers host Ajax on Tuesday knowing defeat could leave their imprint on this competition as the team with the worst group-stage performance in history. Dinamo Zagreb - in 2011-12 - lost all six games and finished with a goal difference of -19. Rangers have conceded 18 more than they have scored. Malik Tillman's eyes widened when the gravity of the situation was laid bare after a cautiously creditable 3-0 mismatch against Napoli. \"Everybody is going to be motivated to finally get a win,\" said the forward of the Ajax encounter. \"It's massive for us and a big challenge. We're going to try to win it.\" Defiant words, certainly, but matching that sort of talk with deed has proved beyond Rangers in Europe this season. Liverpool have done for them twice. So too have Napoli. No disgrace in that, given the disparity in resources. Ajax are more lavishly upholstered, but the manner in which Rangers side capitulated in their opener in the Netherlands was mortifying. Even reversing that 4-0 scoreline next week would not be sufficient for Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side to snatch third place in the section. To tread the more forgiving terrain of the Europa League after new year, they need to score five with no reply. Van Bronckhorst asked for a show of character in Naples. For his players to smother any fear and embrace playing in the fervent surrounds of the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. And they did. But only after their rapier hosts punctured them twice in the opening 16 minutes with two goals of ruthless simplicity by Giovanni Simeone. The concession of Leo Ostigard's late header was similarly straightforward. \"It was a tough watch,\" said BBC Scotland pundit and former Rangers forward Neil McCann. \"Napoli turned the engine down and allowed Rangers to get closer. It could have been a lot worse, because Napoli are a top side.\" McCann's former team-mate Steven Thompson echoed those sentiments on Sportsound, calling the campaign \"a step too far\" for this group of players. \"I believe it's had the opposite effect that a Champions League run should have on a club,\" he said.  \"It has been a sobering campaign. Van Bronckhorst will be desperate for it to be over. He will get more criticism after tonight and for him, and for the club, it has been damaging.\" Yet the trip to Naples was not as disfiguring as had been feared by many of the Rangers fans who travelled despite not being permitted inside the stadium. Rangers have leaked five, six and - earlier this month by Liverpool - seven goals in Europe before. One supporter muttered in hushed tones that eight wasn't out of the question this time. Despite Napoli's early brace amplifying those concerns, Rangers did not collapse.  Granted, their hospitable hosts eased off, but there was a diligence, a resolve, and even a little ambition from the visitors. Indeed, quite how Alfredo Morelos did not convert Ridvan Yilmaz's tempting cross remains a mystery. It means Rangers go into Saturday's key Scottish Premiership meeting with Aberdeen a little less vulnerable than they otherwise might have.  Four points adrift of Celtic and amid a slog of dreary domestic displays, they need a performance as much as result to replenish some of the supporters' belief in the increasingly beleaguered manager. Thompson said victory over Aberdeen \"buys Van Bronckhorst time\". Another three days later would buy Rangers some continental consolation at the end of a humbling few weeks.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63404358"},
{"title": "Barcelona exit Champions League as Inter Milan join Bayern Munich in last 16", "content": "354 Inter Milan secured their place in the Champions League knockout stage and sent Barcelona into the Europa League with victory against Viktoria Plzen. Barcelona's fate was already sealed before Xavi's side lost 3-0 to Group C winners Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp. Substitute Romelu Lukaku marked his return from injury with a late goal as Inter comfortably secured the win that sent them to the last 16. Edin Dzeko scored twice after Henrikh Mkhitaryan's opener in the 4-0 win. It means Barcelona are guaranteed to finish third and compete in Europe's second-tier competition for the second successive season. The Spanish giants were unable to improve the mood among the home support in their final home group game as first-half goals from Sadio Mane and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting put Bayern on course to maintain their perfect record in this season's Champions League. Barcelona thought they had been given a lifeline before half-time but referee Anthony Taylor overturned his initial penalty decision after being sent to review Matthijs de Ligt's challenge on former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski on the pitchside monitor. Serge Gnabry's curled finish was ruled out for offside after the restart, but the German registered three assists on the night as substitute Benjamin Pavard added to Barcelona's misery in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Although many home supporters began leaving long before the final whistle, a group of fans did stay behind and applauded as their players returned to the field at the end of a dismal night for the club. Having kept their fate in their own hands  with a 3-3 draw at Barcelona  a fortnight ago, Simone Inzaghi's Inter completed the job with a game to spare as they made it five wins in six games in all competitions. With Inzaghi serving a touchline ban, Federico Dimarco was denied at close range by Plzen goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek as Inter dominated from the start at the San Siro. Midfielder Mkhitaryan headed in Alessandro Bastoni's cross from the left as Inter broke the deadlock with their 10th attempt after 35 minutes. Dzeko slotted in from Dimarco's pass to double the lead over the Czech champions before the interval. Mkhitaryan struck the post 10 minutes into the second half, but Dzeko's second from a Lautaro Martinez assist put the result beyond doubt. Lukaku added a fourth within four minutes of coming off the bench in his first appearance since August because of a hamstring injury.  It doesn't look good. It is certainly a bruise to Barcelona's ego and their pride as a club. There has been so much pressure on them because of the financial pressure to deliver on the pitch and generate as much money as possible. It will be a really big blow for them not to get out of the group stage because they will have budgeted for making the quarter-finals. They will have to come up with other solutions - such as in the January transfer window, they may look to offload some of their higher earners. Barcelona still have possibilities to win silverware. The domestic cup is definitely attainable and they could still win the league of course. And the Europa League, why not? Yes this is a blow to their confidence in the short run but by the time we return from the World Cup it will be an entirely different situation.  Xavi has come under criticism but that has subsided in the last few games and for now those criticisms have been silenced.

{"title": "Tottenham 1-1 Sporting Lisbon: Antonio Conte furious as VAR rules out late winner", "content": "From dancing on the touchline to shouting in despair, Antonio Conte went through an emotionally charged finish to Tottenham's Champions League game with Sporting Lisbon. The Italian had been celebrating  what he thought was a dramatic injury-time winner  by Harry Kane, one that would have sent his side through to the last 16. But the celebrations were halted as the referee consulted the video assistant referee and, after a lengthy wait, the goal was ruled out for offside.  A furious Conte was sent off as he reacted. Instead of winning 2-1, Spurs drew 1-1. \"This decision creates a big damage. I hope the club understands this. The club has to be strong,\" he said. It could be a huge moment in Tottenham's Champions League campaign - they must go to Marseille next week and avoid defeat if they are to progress. Conte is expected to serve a touchline ban for Tuesday's fixture at Stade Velodrome. He would not be allowed to contact his players before or during the game and would have to sit in the stand. The moment of controversy came in the 95th minute as Kane prodded home after Emerson Royal had headed the ball into his path, via a deflection off a defender. However, VAR determined that Kane was in an offside position when the ball was played to him and, despite the protestations from several Spurs players, on-field referee Danny Makkelie would not be dissuaded from standing by that decision. \"I think you can see from the celebrations we thought we won it. I don't really know what happened at the end,\" Tottenham defender Matt Doherty to BT Sport. \"I thought because it went backwards and hit a defender it was a different phase of play. I'll have to look at the rule book. A few of us don't have a clue what happened.\" As explained by ESPN editor and VAR writer Dale Johnson, the direction a ball is played is irrelevant for offside, with Kane ahead of the ball and the second-to-last defender. The decision will have been all the more frustrating for Conte given that it came just a few days after Tottenham were on wrong end of another controversial VAR decision. On Sunday, Spurs' opponents Newcastle had their opening goal awarded after a lengthy VAR check before going on to win 2-1. On that occasion, Conte declined to comment about VAR, instead directing a message to the club's board as he called for money, time and patience to turn Tottenham into a truly competitive side. But after Wednesday's game, he could not hold in his feelings on the subject.  \"I would like to see if you can take this type of decision with a top team in an important game,\" he said. \"I would like to see if VAR is so brave to take this decision.  \"The ball is in front of Kane. I'm sorry but I'm really upset because you can assess the situation. I don't see honesty in this type of situation. When I don't see this, I become really upset.\" Former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton understood Conte's frustrations, but also felt Tottenham should not have been in a position where they were scrambling for a late winner. \"I get the unhappiness on the decision because the more I look at it, the more it looks onside,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live.  \"But Spurs were so passive in the first half and so way off it. Had they started the game like they played in the second half, this would have been so one-sided. \"It is a big moment because they've got to go to Marseille, which is a really hostile place, and get a result. They are under pressure.\" Everton winger Andros Townsend, formerly of Spurs, added on 5 Live: \"The bottom line for me, whether it's offside or onside is irrelevant. I don't like VAR for this reason, as a football fan, you're killing the raw emotion of the game.  \"You've seen Conte running on the pitch, injured players are running on the pitch. Harry Kane has gone mad, the fans have gone mad. And then 10 minutes later the goal gets disallowed. This is not what football is about. Football is about raw emotion.  \"Slowly VAR is dragging out the raw emotion of the game we love.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63408599"},

{"title": "Rico Lewis: Pep Guardiola hails 'dream' Manchester City teenager", "content": "Pep Guardiola hailed 17-year-old Rico Lewis' Champions League night to remember and assured the youngster he earned it because \"we don't give presents\" at Manchester City. Bury-born Lewis has been with City since he was eight. He marked his full debut by driving home the Blues' equaliser in  their 3-1 group stage win  over Sevilla. In doing so, he was eclipsing Karim Benzema as the youngest player to score on his first start in the competition. He left the field to a standing ovation, which was more pronounced because he had to walk halfway around the pitch after being told to leave it on the far side by the referee when he was replaced by Joao Cancelo five minutes from time. \"We don't give presents here,\" said Guardiola. \"He had to earn it. \"The people love players from the academy but we see him every day. We know he has quality and I am really happy for him.\" Guardiola took Lewis on City's pre-season tour of the United States this summer after the youngster was recommended by the club's youth coaches. He said his squad realised within two minutes at training the youngster was someone they could rely on. \"He played for a few minutes against Bayern Munich in pre-season and also in the training sessions. We felt he had something special. \"The players didn't know him before. But you know good players in two minutes. They knew they could rely on him 100%.\" Guardiola says Lewis will have to be patient because the competition for the right-back slot, where Cancelo, Manuel Akanji and John Stones - all internationals who are likely to be at the World Cup later this month - have featured this term, have more experience. But he will get more chances, potentially as soon as next week's Carabao Cup third round tie with Chelsea. And that, according to Guardiola, is great news for a club that, for all the money they have spent on star players, has also developed the likes of Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Brahim Diaz and Cole Palmer, who also started against Sevilla. \"Sometimes you think we'll have to buy full-backs, knowing how expensive it is,\" said the City manager. \"But we can give someone from the academy the chance. That's the dream. It is good for the economy of the club and we can rely on him. I am very pleased with the way they are working.\" Evidently, Lewis has a long road ahead if he is to make it at a club of City's stature. However, his start has been good and even old professionals such as former Arsenal and England defender Martin Keown, who is not impressed easily, had positive words for Lewis on BT Sport. \"It's a big moment for him and his family, the amount of training sessions he will have been to with the dream of representing City,\" he said.  \"To play and score, it's a dream come true for him. It's only the first step, the first rung on the ladder - when you get in the first team, you want more of this.

{"title": "Ajax 0-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp's side reach Champions League last 16", "content": "1292 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says qualifying for the Champions League knockout phase should \"never be taken for granted\" after his side sealed their spot in the last 16. The Reds put their domestic woes behind them to progress from Group A with a clinical second-half display against Ajax in Amsterdam. Needing a draw to reach the next stage, Klopp's side were fortunate not to be behind before Mohamed Salah clipped in with their only shot on target of the first half. Darwin Nunez, back in the starting line-up after injury, should have doubled the lead before half-time but the £64m summer signing struck a post with an open goal in front of him. However, the Uruguay forward quickly made amends by powering in a precise header from Andy Robertson's corner shortly after the restart. Moments later, England Under-21 midfielder Harvey Elliott added the third by latching on to Salah's reverse pass and lashing into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Liverpool's decisive finishing clinched a place in the last 16 for the sixth successive season. \"Qualifying for the knockout stages, I think nobody ever should take for granted - it's really difficult,\" said Klopp. \"We did it again, which is a big achievement in itself.\" The comfortable victory means the Reds host Napoli in next week's final round of group-stage fixtures safe in the knowledge their place is assured. Liverpool's inconsistent start to the season, epitomised by another disjointed performance in a shock 1-0 Premier League defeat at Nottingham Forest at the weekend, has frustrated their supporters and left some wondering about the direction of Klopp's side. The prospect of a smooth passage to the Champions League knockout phase was far from certain after a 4-1 defeat by Napoli in their opening group game. But their vast experience in Europe's premier club competition, in which they were champions in 2019 and runners-up last season, has eventually provided much-needed comfort, as they brushed away any early fears of not progressing. Home and away victories over Rangers and Ajax have propelled the Reds into last 16, while the prize of finishing group winners is still up for grabs if they can beat Napoli by a four-goal margin at Anfield. Despite being far from their best in Amsterdam, particularly in the first half, Liverpool's quality and know-how eventually shone through against the Dutch champions. Asked if the performance would provide a lift for his squad, Klopp told BT Sport: \"Look, we don't have to talk about it all the time but it is clear.  \"It is really helpful for the club, it is important for everybody and of course gives us a lift. Tonight we feel all great.\" Things could have been much different had Ajax taken either of the two glorious chances which they spurned before Salah's strike. A slick move carved open the visitors in the third minute, only for Steven Berghuis to hit the post when he had time and space in the penalty box. With Liverpool lacking cohesion and not managing a serious effort on the home goal, another clear-cut chance went begging when they piled forward on the counter-attack shortly after the half-hour mark.  The quick surge left Liverpool outnumbered at the back, but right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold showed excellent positional sense to block Dusan Tadic's goal-bound shot. Injuries to key players have not helped the Reds' momentum this season, a point emphasised by Klopp in the build-up to the trip to Amsterdam. Being able to welcome back Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson added a much-needed layer of experience at Johan Cruyff Arena, with Nunez offering a focal point in their attack. Now Klopp's task is to ensure his side can finally start stringing together convincing performances in the Premier League, starting with Saturday's visit of a Leeds United side bereft of confidence.

{"title": "Champions League final: Uefa 'responsible' for chaos before Liverpool v Real Madrid in Paris", "content": "Uefa bears \"primary responsibility\" for the chaotic scenes that \"almost led to disaster\" before last year's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, says an independent report. Fans were penned in and teargassed outside Paris's Stade de France as kick-off was delayed by 36 minutes. \"It is remarkable no one lost their life,\" said the report, which Uefa commissioned after the 28 May final. Uefa and French authorities initially blamed ticketless fans for the events. The report says there is \"no evidence\" to support the \"reprehensible\" claims. \"The panel has concluded that Uefa, as event owner, bears primary responsibility for failures which almost led to disaster,\" said the report. \"All the stakeholders interviewed by the panel have agreed that this situation was a near-miss: a term used when an event almost turns into a mass fatality catastrophe.\" While it said there was \"contributory fault\" from other bodies - particularly French police and the French Football Federation - the findings said European governing body Uefa was \"at the wheel\". \"Uefa should have retained a monitoring and oversight role [of security], to ensure it all worked. It self-evidently did not,\" the report added. Uefa commissioned the independent report three days after the match - the showpiece of European club football which Liverpool went on to lose 1-0 - took place in the French capital. The European governing body said a \"comprehensive review\" would examine a number of factors that include the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final. The investigation found eight key factors that \"almost led to disaster\" because of Uefa's failure, which included: It also said the collective action of Liverpool supporters was \"probably instrumental\" in preventing \"more serious injuries and deaths\" outside the stadium. The investigation was chaired by Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues, a Portuguese politician, with the panel also including experts and consultants from legal, policing and event-management fields, along with representatives from football fan groups. \"The enthusiasm around the game rapidly turned into a real 'near miss' which was harmful to a significant number of fans from both clubs,\" said Dr Rodrigues. \"This should never have happened at such an important sporting event, and it is unacceptable that it took place at the heart of the European continent.\" The report made 21 recommendations in an attempt to ensure \"everything possible is done\" to prevent any similar incident happening again at a major sporting event. It also warned French authorities this should be a \"wake-up call\" before it hosts the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. For many Liverpool fans, the incident and subsequent attempted attribution of blame on supporters has evoked painful memories of the Hillsborough disaster. Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, where fans were crushed because of overcrowding in the Leppings Lane End at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. After years of smear campaigns, a new inquest concluded in 2016 the behaviour of Liverpool supporters played no part in the deaths and those who died were unlawfully killed.  The accusations made by Uefa and French authorities about alleged ticketless Liverpool fans in Paris were criticised by the Rodrigues-led report. \"The parallels between Hillsborough 1989 and Paris 2022 are palpable,\" it added. \"The similarities include the fact both events were preventable and both were caused by the failures of those responsible for public safety.  \"Both events were foreseeable.\" Following the publication of the review into the Paris scenes, Uefa apologised \"most sincerely\" for the events which unfolded. Uefa said it would also announce a \"special refund scheme\" for affected fans. \"In particular, I would like to apologise to the supporters of Liverpool,\" Uefa general secretary Theodore Theodoridis said. \"For the experiences many of them had when attending the game and for the messages released prior to and during the game, which had the effect of unjustly blaming them for the situation leading to the delayed kick-off.\" Uefa initially aimed to publish the findings of the investigation by November last year. The report was released on Monday, about an hour before Liverpool's home game against Merseyside rivals Everton. Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, says the findings \"vindicated\" the Liverpool fans who had said Uefa and the French authorities were responsible for the events. \"Fans who travelled to Paris expecting the night of their lives were put in harm's way by the very people who are meant to protect them,\" Rotheram, who was at the match, said. \"The organisation before, during and after the game - and the heavy-handed treatment of fans - was predicated on flawed intelligence and the inaccurate preconceptions and prejudices of the authorities.\" The findings were thought to be set for publication on Tuesday, but details of the investigation's conclusions were reported by a number of media organisations earlier on Monday. Liverpool said they had not received a copy of the report before seeing the stories in the media. \"It's hugely disappointing that a report of such significance, such importance to football supporters' lives and future safety, should be leaked and published in this way,\" said the club. Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly was also unhappy the report had been leaked before being seen by the club and their supporters. \"It's disappointing and insensitive to release a report of this magnitude without first releasing to supporters who were there,\" a spokesman told the BBC. Uefa initially blamed the \"late arrival\" of fans for the problems, which delayed kick-off by more than half an hour. Many Liverpool fans said they had been at the stadium hours before kick-off - scheduled for 21:00 local time - but were stopped from getting into the ground. The gates opened at 18:00 local time and fans had been told to arrive early to ease congestion.  Liverpool supporters arriving shortly after that time said already-large crowds were not moving through a ticket checkpoint and led to fans being crammed in underpasses outside the stadium. Five minutes before kick-off, at 20:55, Uefa announced that the start of the match was delayed \"for security reasons\" until 21:15. Eyewitnesses said the French police began to use pepper spray, causing the crowd to stampede backwards and leaving some of them vomiting as others rushed for water from neighbouring bars to ease the pain. At 21:14 Uefa announced a further delay to kick-off. Eventually, the match began at 21:36. France's interior and sports ministers acknowledged difficulties in managing crowds at the final but initially pointed blame at Liverpool fans and local youths trying to force their way into the stadium. French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said Liverpool had let their supporters \"out in the wild\", prompting Liverpool chairman Tom Werner to demand an apology for her comments. Shortly after the final, a spokesperson for France's independent police commissioner's union (SICP), Mathieu Valet, told the BBC's Newshour that \"supporters without tickets or with fake tickets were not the main problem\". He said it was down to \"three or four hundred French and undocumented delinquents\" who had gained access to the stadium's concourse. \"It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64631335"},

{"title": "Champions League final: What we learned from report on Liverpool v Real Madrid in Paris", "content": "\"It is remarkable that no-one lost their life.\" That's the damning conclusion of  an independent report  into the chaos at last year's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid at Stade de France. Fans have told of severe congestion, being attacked by locals and tear-gassed by police - one supporter called it a \"carnival of horrors\" which bore echoes of the  1989 Hillsborough disaster  in which 97 Liverpool fans died. The panel has concluded that European football governing body Uefa, as event owner,  \"bears primary responsibility  for failures which almost led to disaster.\" It also criticised the \"reprehensible\" attempt by authorities to incorrectly claim thousands of Liverpool fans without valid tickets caused the problems. Here, BBC Sport picks out new detail and first-hand testimony from the report - including from fans who had also been at Hillsborough - outlining how events unfolded. A rail strike meant only one of two train lines to the stadium was fully operational. So thousands of Liverpool fans travelling from the centre of Paris all arrived at the same station, Stade de France Saint-Denis.  The 15-minute walking route to the stadium was not signposted and fans were directed into a built-up area, through a narrow subway and motorway underpass - partially blocked by police vans. It led to a checkpoint at the end of a 30-foot-wide ramp, which was not designated as a main entrance. \"We were stuck for an hour and a half under a bridge. No toilets, no water. We were... I mean, I don't know what time, cos I couldn't get a hand in my pocket to... it was that squashed,\" 71-year-old Liverpool fan Sheila Reeson told the panel.  In October, Uefa was accused of \"abject failure\" in a report which examined  more than 480 testimonies  and was published by an independent panel, which included Professor Phil Scraton, who previously led a report into the Hillsborough stadium disaster. Huge congestion built up at checkpoints as tickets were checked. The system was complicated by a mix of paper and digital tickets. An estimated 15,000 fans were crowded in that area more than two and a half hours before kick-off.  A risk of crushing developed - particularly traumatic for Liverpool fans, specifically Hillsborough survivors - and ticket pre-checks were abandoned. Local youths gained access to the perimeter of the stadium. Some jumped the fence or tried to steal tickets from fans who were penned in as the turnstiles had been closed. It was estimated 300-400 locals committed \"numerous acts of theft with violence observed by the police\".  Having allowed congestion to build up to dangerous levels outside the perimeter, the police's response was to indiscriminately pepper-spray fans - including children - pressed up against the railings in an attempt to relieve pressure on the turnstiles. \"I started receiving messages saying our disabled supporters were being gassed and crushed outside the turnstiles,\" said Ted Morris, chair of the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association. \"They started contacting me, saying they were terrified and panicking. It was harrowing to receive these messages with me unable to help them. They said the situation outside the stadium was becoming critical, and they feared for their lives. \"The saddest thing about this is that our disabled fans have arrived in Paris to attend a football festival, but at that very moment they are in the middle of a carnival of horrors which will leave them with long-term mental scars.\" The panel said the use of pepper spray was \"weaponry which has no place at a festival of football\". It added: \"The dangerous conditions on the concourse outside the turnstiles were compounded by the police deploying tear gas at disorderly groups of locals, as well as using pepper spray on supporters trying to gain entrance with valid tickets. It is remarkable that no-one lost their life. \"All the stakeholders interviewed by the panel have agreed that this situation was a near-miss: a term used when an event almost turns into a mass-fatality catastrophe. \"The parallels between Hillsborough 1989 and Paris 2022 are palpable. The similarities include the fact that both events were preventable, and both were caused by the failures of those responsible for public safety.\" Liverpool fan Jim Galvin, who had been at Hillsborough, said: \"The police were like stormtroopers, like Terminators, were just coming along with the baton, just almost swatting everyone down. \"I finally managed to get my daughter up [over the wall] and the lads pulled her over and then with that, one of the stewards came and just started... started punching, punching me in the face and everything. Which wasn't very nice, but it was because he was kind of leaning down. He was 7-8 foot in the air and leaning down to me. \"And you could just see the people, you know, in authority, on the other side of the fence, that were just standing and laughing at you.\" The report says that it was actually Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin who ultimately took the decision to delay kick-off, while standing in a stairwell after having a meeting with the King of Spain in the stadium VIP area. Kick-off was first delayed for 15 minutes, eventually for 36 minutes, with an initial message displayed on screens inside incorrectly blaming Liverpool fans' late arrival which prompted outrage from Reds supporters already inside. The panel found Uefa's safety and security unit was \"marginalised\" by the Uefa events organisers and did not perform the required role of overseeing safety requirements.  The decision taken by Ceferin should have been made by the police commander in the control room, in liaison with Uefa and the French Football Federation's safety advisers, the report said. \"I think the hardest thing was to see my son and my husband in tears when we got inside, cos my husband thought, he said the first thing he thought was he was going to lose me,\" said fan Reeson. \"If it hadn't had been for a lot of the Liverpool fans, the male Liverpool fans, I don't know that I'd have survived because they kept people back from me, so I'd got space. \"I've never been in a crush like that before, but there were lots... I could hear people saying 'This is Hillsborough.' This is, this is, you know, people were squashed at the fence.  \"They spoke to police through the fence and they got pepper sprayed. They didn't get [an] answer, they just got pepper sprayed for asking 'What's going on? Why are we not being let in?'\" As the match drew to a close, police in riot gear emerged inside the stadium and positioned themselves around Liverpool - but not Madrid's - end. Meanwhile, a lack of presence outside the stadium contributed to gangs running riot against defenceless supporters. \"It was like five hours of sheer hell, where at no point did you feel like anyone was going to do anything for you. You were just on your own,\" said Liverpool fan Tony Fitzgerald. \"And if you didn't do anything yourself, that was it. You know, you're at the mercy of these gangs. \"It was just lawless. It was like being somewhere in a war zone.\" The report calls the policing operation \"defective\". Officers had prepared for hooliganism, despite information from Merseyside and Spanish police and the clubs that there had been \"no significant issues of football-related violence\" involving either set of fans in recent years. Thousands of Liverpool supporters who went to Paris without match tickets did so to enjoy the atmosphere, not to seek entry to the stadium. \"The police, unchallenged and accepted without question by other stakeholders, adopted a model aimed at a non-existent threat from football hooligans, together with a preoccupation that ticketless supporters required a public order policing approach rather than one based upon facilities and engagement,\" said the report. Joe Blott, chair of the Spirit of Shankly Liverpool supporters' group said: \"Only the exemplary behaviour of Liverpool fans, who waited with patience and composure, prevented deaths in the dangerous crushes caused by Uefa and relevant authorities at the Stade de France.  \"The collective memory and pain of the Hillsborough disaster means Liverpool fans know how to behave to avoid catastrophe.  \"The similarities between things the French senate was told by ministers, and the lies told by authorities in the UK after Hillsborough, have been an enormous source of shock, anger and pain.\" Uefa commissioned the team led by Portuguese politician Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues to look into the issues, with the panel also including experts and consultants from legal, policing and event-management fields, along with representatives from football fan groups. General secretary Theodore Theodoridis said Uefa was committed to learning lessons from what went wrong. \"On behalf of Uefa, I would like to apologise most sincerely once again to all those who were affected by the events that unfolded on what should have been a celebration at the pinnacle of the club season,\" he said. \"In particular, I would like to apologise to the supporters of Liverpool FC for the experiences many of them had when attending the game and for the messages released prior to and during the game which had the effect of unjustly blaming them for the situation leading to the delayed kick-off.\"  Police chief Didier Lallement told the French senate last year he was sorry for authorising the use of tear gas. \"It is obviously a failure. It was a failure because people were pushed around and attacked. It was a failure because the image of the country was undermined,\" he said. The report has made 21 recommendations in an attempt to ensure \"everything possible is done\" to prevent any similar incident happening again at a major sporting event. Safety and security should be at the centre of match planning, with a \"facilitation and service\" approach towards supporters, rather than viewing them as a potential public order problem, it said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64636054"},
{"title": "Reaction as Barcelona exit Champions League at group stage for second successive season", "content": "\"Complete failure\", \"penance\", \"night of terror\" - the morning headlines were unforgiving in Spain as Barcelona crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage for the second year running.  With a  game to spare, Barcelona's 3-0 home defeat by Bayern Munich on Wednesday left them certain of finishing third and dropping into the Europa League. Manager Xavi and president Joan Laporta were keen to play down that the five-time Champions League winners would enter Europe's second-tier competition once again. But 19-year-old midfielder Pedri was more critical, claiming Barcelona \"don't deserve to be in the Champions League\". \"For me it's a failure,\" he added. Laporta, however, stated: \"This is a young project.  \"From the beginning we knew we were going to have ups and downs.\" In Europe, there have been more downs than ups for Barcelona this season as they picked up just four points from five Champions League games. They opened their campaign brightly with a 5-1 win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen, but lost to Bayern Munich and Inter Milan before being held by Inter to a 3-3 draw at the Nou Camp. \"This is our reality and we need to face it,\" Xavi said after the Bayern defeat. \"Maybe that's what we needed, to be given a beating in order to grow. \"It was already over, too late to do anything. The main reason that we got to this situation was because of our own mistakes in the previous games, we failed to be effective up front.\" Before the 2022-23 season began, Barcelona spent almost £200m on new players despite the club being more than £1bn in debt. They were initially unable to register a number of their new signings because of La Liga financial regulations, but the club freed up funding using several  'economic levers'  which included selling a percentage of their future television rights and of their media production unit Barca Studios. This approach from Laporta has led to accusations that he is \"gambling\" with the club's long-term future. Barcelona have fared better in La Liga, winning nine of their 11 matches, but they sit second behind rivals Real Madrid, who inflicted a 3-1 defeat on Xavi's side earlier this month. Commenting on the Champions League exit, Xavi said his team needed to \"fight for the other trophies left\". \"We need to stick together, our fans were great tonight, it was great to see more than 85,000 at Camp Nou supporting us till the end. Bad thing we didn't show up on the pitch,\" he said. \"There are still other tournaments to play. It's a hard blow but we need to be self-critical to be able to win those titles.\" Atletico Madrid, Champions League runners up in 2014 and 2016, were also dumped out of the competition's group stage after they failed to beat Bayer Leverkusen. Yannick Carrasco missed a penalty in added time which would have given Diego Simeone's side a win and kept their chances of reaching the knockout rounds alive. \"The Champions League has been cruel to me,\" Simeone said. \"We lost two finals, one on penalties and another in the 93rd minute. \"But I'm hard-headed and I will continue to try as long as I have the opportunity to qualify for the Champions League and then find the something we lack.\" Formation    4-3-3 Formation    4-2-3-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63404663"},
{"title": "Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Chelsea: Blues haunted by scoring issues again", "content": "Twenty one shots, eight on target, no goals and another defeat. It was a familiar story for Chelsea on Wednesday as they showed a lack of a cutting edge in the final third on their way  to defeat by Borussia Dortmund in Germany. The Blues had enough chances to win the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie - and win it comfortably - but poor finishing, great saves and the woodwork conspired against them. There has, understandably, been plenty of scrutiny focused on Graham Potter since he became Chelsea boss in September, but even his biggest critics must sympathise with him after this loss. Against a Dortmund side who had won every game they had played so far in 2023, the visitors were the better side for large periods, but as chances came and went before Karim Adeyemi broke to score a brilliant solo goal for the hosts, it must have felt like luck had once again deserted Potter and Chelsea. \"Overall we were pleased with the performance for big parts of the game,\" said Potter. \"It was an even first half, we managed the game quite well and had some good opportunities. In the second half, apart from the decisive action where we didn't do well enough, I thought we were the dominant, better team. \"We need a bit of luck maybe in the final execution and I think we deserved a goal. We have to keep going. It is half-time and we look forward to Stamford Bridge.\" Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman, watching the game for BBC Radio 5 Live, agreed with Potter's assessment and felt they did not get the result their performance warranted. \"I am wondering how Chelsea have lost,\" he said. \"I think they played really well at times, they created really good opportunities but the thing that has troubled them in their past four or five games has haunted them again.\" As mentioned, Chelsea had 21 shots on goal at Dortmund with eight of those on target. The Blues' expected goals, which measures how good your chances were, was 2.14 - the fourth-highest rating of any team in this season's Champions League without scoring. The lack of goals is an issue that has troubled Chelsea throughout Potter's time at the club so far. In his 24 matches, they have scored just 25 goals. They have not managed more than one goal in match since 2 November. Their struggles in the final third make it all the more bewildering that despite spending around £288m in January - more than the combined total of all clubs in the Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 - they did not invest in a proven out-and-out striker, while also leaving former Arsenal and Barcelona forward Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang out of their Champions League squad. Joao Felix, one of the January arrivals, put in a superb performance, particular in the first half, but he was guilty of some of Chelsea's biggest missed opportunities, shooting over from a good position in the first half and then hitting the crossbar when it seemed easier to score. Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez, who joined Chelsea for a British record £107m fee last month, also saw a brilliant late strike kept out by Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. \"The players have been working really well,\" Potter said. \"They know the situation we are in and the challenges we have but it is exciting. Their attitude has been really, really good. The spirit is there in the team; we just need a little bit of luck.\" There were lots of positives to take from Chelsea's overall display but while Dortmund can't stop winning in 2023, the Blues have managed just one win in nine games so far this year. Potter believes the fans can see and appreciate the good things his side have been doing, but he knows those wins need to start coming soon.  \"The performance [against Dortmund] was another step forward for us,\" he added. \"Hopefully we improve and I think we will and in three weeks time we can take the game at Stamford Bridge.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64658320"},
{"title": "Paris St-Germain 0-1 Bayern Munich: Kingsley Coman strikes as Germans snatch last-16 first-leg lead", "content": "336 Kingsley Coman repeated his 2020 Champions League final heroics as Bayern Munich beat Paris St-Germain in their last-16 first-leg tie. The Frenchman volleyed home the winner early in the second half in Paris. Coman also scored the only goal when Bayern overcame his former club PSG to win the trophy three years ago. Substitute Kylian Mbappe, back after injury, looked to have rescued a draw for the hosts, but his late effort was ruled out for offside in the build-up. Ligue 1 champions PSG have now lost their last three matches in all competitions. In contrast, Bayern are unbeaten in all competitions since 17 September and now favourites to reach the quarter-finals, despite having defender Benjamin Pavard sent off for a second booking in injury time. PSG were boosted beforehand with Lionel Messi fit enough to start up front after recovering from a hamstring injury, while Mbappe was on the bench. There was also a start in midfield for Warren Zaire-Emery who, at 16 years and 343 days, became the youngest player ever to start a Champions League knockout stage game.  The Frenchman was born in 2006, the same year in which Messi, 35, won his first Champions League title. Mbappe, initially expected to miss this match with a thigh injury, was brought on after 57 minutes, but was clearly far from full fitness. PSG struggled to create any chances of note in the first half, while Bayern dominated possession but lacked a cutting edge until Coman struck in the 53rd minute. The winger, who started in the youth team at PSG, met a deep Alphonso Davies cross from the left with a first-time volley. Coman's effort squeezed under PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, although the Italian made up for it later with superb saves to deny Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pavard. Mbappe's arrival lifted PSG and Yann Sommer kept out his close-range shot before the Bayern keeper was beaten in the 82nd minute. Home celebrations were cut short, though, as left-back Nuno Mendes was ruled narrowly offside by the video assistant referee (VAR) before he delivered a cross for Mbappe to finish into the roof of the net. Following losses to Marseille in the Coupe de France and Monaco in Ligue 1, another damaging defeat piles the pressure on manager Christophe Galtier. PSG, who have still never won the Champions League, now face a tough task in the return leg in Germany on 8 March.

{"title": "Champions League final: Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson says report must be 'turning point'", "content": "Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson says the outcome of an independent report into last season's Champions League final in Paris must be a \"turning point\" for how fans are treated. Fans were penned in and teargassed outside Stade de France at the game against Real Madrid on 28 May 2022. The report ruled Uefa bore  \"primary responsibility\"  for the chaotic scenes, adding it was \"remarkable\" no-one died. \"The sooner action is taken, the better,\" said Henderson. The England midfielder tweeted: \"The Paris report needs to be a turning point for the treatment of football fans. No one should have their safety jeopardised by inadequate organisation.\" Liverpool want Uefa to \"fully and transparently\" fulfil recommendations made in the report and action must be taken \"to ensure there are no more near misses\". The club added the \"fundamental safety failings\" had \"exacerbated the suffering\" of the families, friends and survivors of the  1989 Hillsborough disaster . \"We implore Uefa to fully enact the recommendations as outlined by the panel - no matter how difficult - to ensure supporter safety is the number one priority at the heart of every Uefa football fixture,\" Liverpool said. The report - commissioned by Uefa three days after the final which Liverpool lost 1-0 - made 21 recommendations in an attempt to ensure \"everything possible is done\" to prevent a similar incident happening at a major sporting event. The recommendations include using only digital tickets and Uefa ensuring its own safety and security unit has \"primary responsibility\" for Champions League final operations. It also warned French authorities this should be a \"wake-up call\" before it hosts the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Liverpool MP Ian Byrne has written to French president Emmanuel Macron demanding \"nothing short of a full public apology\". Uefa and French authorities initially blamed ticketless Liverpool fans for the events, but the report - released on Monday - said there was \"no evidence\" to support the \"reprehensible\" claims. It added the collective action of Liverpool supporters was \"probably instrumental\" in preventing \"more serious injuries and deaths\" outside the stadium. \"Shocking false narratives were peddled in the immediate aftermath of that night in Paris; narratives that have since been totally disproven,\" said Liverpool.  \"The independent French Senate report published in July 2022 found Liverpool supporters were unfairly and wrongly blamed for the chaotic scenes to divert attention from the real organisational failures.  \"The Independent Senate report also published 15 recommendations for improvements. No action has been taken on these recommendations to date.\" For many Liverpool fans, the incident and subsequent attempted attribution of blame on supporters evoked painful memories of the Hillsborough disaster. Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, where fans were crushed because of overcrowding in the Leppings Lane end at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. \"It is shocking that more than 30 years after the Hillsborough disaster any club and our group of fans would be subject to such fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,\" the club added. \"But even more concerning is the realisation that for families, friends and survivors of Hillsborough, Paris has only exacerbated their suffering.  \"Our thoughts go out to all our fans who have suffered as a result of Paris and we would remind them of the mental health support we put in place in the days following the disaster that was the Uefa Champions League final in Paris.\" The report was released about an hour before Liverpool's home win against Merseyside rivals Everton on Monday. The findings were thought to be set for publication on Tuesday, but details of the investigation's conclusions were reported by a number of media organisations earlier on Monday. Liverpool said they had not received a copy of the report before seeing the stories in the media. On Tuesday, Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly said, like Liverpool, it welcomed the report's findings into the \"horrendous situations\" that unfolded in Paris. \"What should have been the highlight of the season for travelling supporters of Liverpool and Real Madrid - in Uefa's words a 'festival of football' - turned out to be a maelstrom of chaos and alarm that led to some fans fearing for their life,\" the group said. \"The blame game began even before a ball was kicked, and in the immediate aftermath those supposedly in charge - Uefa and the authorities - had no hesitation in pointing the finger at supporters.\" It added it expected an apology from European football's governing body \"for the lies and smears Uefa so quickly aimed at supporters, without whom their competition and showcase final would be nothing\". In his  letter to President Macron , Byrne - Labour MP for Liverpool West Derby - said: \"I am sure you can appreciate that nothing short of a full public apology and retraction by French police authorities, French football authorities, your government and Uefa will suffice, due to the immense pain caused by this falsified narrative of blame. \"There is an urgent need for a full and unequivocal apology by all parties for this deeply hurtful and - for many Liverpool fans - triggering ploy to shift the blame.\" Speaking to LBC , Paris deputy mayor Pierre Rabadan said the organisation of the final was \"done too quickly\". It was moved to the French capital in February 2022 after Russia was stripped of the match following the nation's invasion of Ukraine. \"The organisation was going probably too quickly, we can say today. Normally the organisation takes around ten months to organise a Champions League final,\" said Rabadan. \"Here everything was organised in the last two months before the events. We can say that they had mistakes.\" The Football Supporters' Association head of policing and casework Amanda Jacks said of the report: \"This is a total exoneration of Liverpool fans who were smeared by those responsible for this fiasco in an attempt to cover up their own failings. \"The panel has made clear to Uefa that this report has to be taken seriously and cannot be allowed to sit in a drawer gathering dust.\" More than 2,000 Liverpool supporters who claim they were injured or left with psychological trauma after the final are part of a class-action lawsuit against Uefa seeking damages. Tony Winterburn, of law firm Pogust Goodhead who are co-running the legal case, said: \"An apology is a start, but it simply does not go far enough.  \"We want our clients, alongside all other fans who have been proven to be blameless, to be compensated for the psychological and physical trauma they experienced on that day and for the subsequent trauma they experienced after the event when authorities continued to place blame at their door despite knowing this was untrue.\" A Football Association spokesperson said: \"We welcome the findings of the very detailed and thorough report, and are pleased that Liverpool fans have been praised for their exemplary behaviour on the night - behaviour which saved lives. \"The reports contains important recommendations which are relevant to everyone involved in the delivery of major football events, and positive action should be taken to ensure that this never happens again.\" Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer  said:  \"We urged a full review into the disturbing events at last year's Champions League final, so I welcome this report - particularly the recognition that Liverpool fans behaved faultlessly throughout. \"I hope Uefa will act on its recommendations so that this doesn't happen at a match again.\" Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: \"Lessons must be learned. This was a 'near miss' of a much more fatal situation. It only didn't become so because of the actions of fans.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64634493"},

Diaz nodded in early on after Spurs goalkeeper Fraser Forster had saved a Theo Hernandez shot and then superbly got a hand on the scorer's initial follow-up attempt. Antonio Conte's side looked relatively comfortable for long periods of the contest against the seven-time European champions - as a youthful pairing of Pape Sarr and Oliver Skipp deputised ably for the suspended Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and the injured Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield. However, they were rarely able to build any attacking momentum with their front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and, until his withdrawal, Dejan Kulusevski well shackled by a disciplined home defence. Aside from ambitious long-range efforts from Emerson Royal and Sarr, Conte's side appeared most capable of threatening from set-pieces but neither Kane nor Eric Dier were able to direct headers on goal from two excellent Son deliveries. In the end, Spurs were grateful for the profligacy of the hosts as Belgian midfielder Charles de Ketelaere and German defender Malick Thiaw both headed excellent opportunities - to put the Italian side firmly in control of the tie - wide.  Had either nodded in from close range, Spurs would have faced an even more challenging recovery operation in the return leg in London on Wednesday, 8 March. As it is, they must try to turn the tie round without Dier, who will be suspended after he collected a second-half booking. Prior to last Friday's victory over Torino, Stefano Pioli's side had endured a miserable start to 2023, picking up just two points from a possible 15 - and slipping to fifth in Serie A. However, while they do not possess the star quality or swagger of the great Milan sides, they displayed plenty of know-how to carve out a slender lead.  Their only regret will be not to have put the tie beyond a Spurs side that competed well but barely laid a glove on them in the final third. As it is, a place in the quarter-finals very much hangs in the balance, although Conte will still have to figure out a way to compensate for the loss of  Uruguay international Bentancur,  who has become a key player since arriving from Juventus just over 12 months ago. The Italian will also demand greater diligence in defence from his side with Argentine Cristian Romero sure to come under scrutiny for his role in Milan's win. The World Cup-winning centre-back was outjumped and left floundering by Hernandez in the build-up to the home side's goal and was later booked for an ill-timed challenge on the lively Rafael Leao. Stopping the Portugal international's menacing runs in the second leg will be critical to Spurs' hopes as they bid to prevent Milan from reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.

{"title": "Chelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund (agg 2-1): Graham Potter enjoys finest night as Blues boss", "content": "948 Graham Potter gazed at the floor as Kai Havertz stepped forward in the moment that had the capacity to release the pressure valve that has been tightening on Chelsea's manager.  Potter's Chelsea were charged with turning around Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 lead from the first leg of this Champions League last-16 tie and Raheem Sterling's first-half goal put them halfway there.  Here, however, was Havertz standing over a re-taken penalty with tension at such a boiling point around Stamford Bridge that Potter simply could not bear to watch as the German stepped forward.  The thunderous roars and the bearhugs from his backroom staff delivered the good news and Chelsea went on to close out a win that was, without question, the finest night of Potter's troubled time at Stamford Bridge.  Make no mistake, the 47-year-old has not only struggled to convince many Chelsea fans of his suitability to tackle this occasionally dysfunctional football beast but has also felt the fierce heat of their criticism since he arrived from Brighton to succeed Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel in September.  Potter faced a potentially defining week only months into his reign after a home defeat by strugglers Southampton and another away at Tottenham turned up the volume on whispers about his future.  Chelsea's new owner Todd Boehly, whose remarkable spending spree only added to the pressure and expectations surrounding Potter, has always insisted he was sticking by his manager but any slips at home to Leeds United and then Borussia Dortmund would have put that faith to the severest test.  Instead, a scrambled win over Leeds was followed by Chelsea's best performance under Potter and now, with a Champions League quarter-final to look forward to, at least some of the clouds have rolled away.  And for Potter, he will hope this night and the celebrations that followed it on and off the pitch will be a launchpad for stability and improvement as well as the all-important connection with Chelsea's fans.  Potter has been criticised for being too passive as Chelsea manager - his calm demeanour on the touchline portrayed as him being some sort of soft touch, something he understandably denied with a passion.  This was a different Potter. A different Chelsea.  In the first few minutes he was windmilling his arms to get Chelsea's fans behind their team and he was animated throughout. Passive? Not here.  And at the final whistle, Potter's beaming face illuminated Stamford Bridge as he marched towards the Matthew Harding Stand before delivering rousing fist pumps in the manner normally associated with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.  Potter then blew kisses towards the stands as the frustrations and uncertainties of recent weeks were transformed into an outpouring of joy.  And owner Boehly, whose riches have bankrolled this seemingly money-no-object new Chelsea era, looked down on it all with what appeared to be a mixture of elation and relief.  Chelsea's two home wins will not send all the troubles floating away but this Champions League victory will do wonders when measured in how supporters feel about their manager. These are the sort of victories that boost the credibility and buy time.  There is still a desperately poor Premier League placing of 10th to be addressed and it still appears that Chelsea may have to win the Champions League to play in the competition next season. Odds against, but Chelsea have done strange things in the Champions League before.  Chelsea looked at home with the outstanding pair of Reece James and Ben Chilwell performing heroically in defence and as an attacking threat - the latter also making Potter's former Brighton player Marc Cucurella look more comfortable than he has on many occasions.  And there was no doubt Chelsea's players were performing for their manager as they tore into tackles from the first whistle, a period which also included an outstanding save from keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga as he dived to save a free-kick from Marco Reus.  Potter and Chelsea must now cash in on this sudden surge of momentum because the doubts will resurface if they revert to their more normal form of this season at struggling Leicester City on Saturday.  This was the sort of night Potter had in mind when he exchanged the stability and calm progress he oversaw at Brighton for what can be the madness of Chelsea - namely scenes of celebration around Stamford Bridge after a landmark Champions League win.  Now Potter has had the taste he will want more and hope the same applies to his re-invigorated Chelsea players. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64883891"},

Chelsea fully deserved their win, although they squandered several big opportunities before Raheem Sterling made the breakthrough after 43 minutes, firing past Dortmund keeper Alexander Meyer after initially fluffing his shot.  The goal which settled the tie and overturned Dortmund's 1-0 advantage from the first leg came in contentious fashion from the penalty spot eight minutes after the break.  Dortmund were furious when a VAR review penalised Marius Wolf for handball from Ben Chilwell's cross and their sense of injustice heightened after Kai Havertz struck the post with his spot-kick only for a re-take to be ordered.  This time Havertz made no mistake and Chelsea were on their way into the last eight.  Speaking after the game, Potter said: \"The players were tremendous and the supporters were tremendous. \"We had to be against a team that were doing so well. Over the two games I felt that we deserved to go through. It was a special night.\" Potter was been waiting for a show of strength such as this from the moment he left Brighton to take over at Chelsea, succeeding Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel. Potter has struggled to convince Chelsea's fans he has the personality required to take on this occasionally dysfunctional football beast and his cause has not been helped by poor Premier League form and a battle to establish any sort of shape and stability from the influx of players assembled at vast expense by new owner Todd Boehly. The pressure was released somewhat with Saturday's narrow win over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge but a big Champions League win against opponents of such European pedigree as Borussia Dortmund will go some way to convincing the doubters that Potter is cut out for the task. There is still much work to do as Chelsea lie in a wholly unacceptable 10th place in the Premier League and two victories will not change the landscape instantly but there is no doubt Stamford Bridge felt like a much happier place when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie sounded his final whistle. Potter will have been satisfied to see big performances from fit-again Reece James with Ben Chilwell also outstanding. And his former Brighton player Marc Cucurella also looked much more at home than he has before. The scenes at the final whistle were a sharp contrast to many witnessed at Stamford Bridge this season with Potter punching the air in front of joyous Chelsea supporters as their Champions League journey continues. Potter added: \"To win a game and go into the last eight of the Champions League, it's up there with one of the games or evenings of my career.  \"I watched the first penalty and it didn't work so well. I can't do anything. It's down to Kai and his talent and testament and that's at the top level.\" All eyes were England teenager Jude Bellingham from the moment he arrived at Stamford Bridge, with waiting Chelsea fans making an instant sales pitch for the young star, who is expected to be pursued by every big club in Europe this summer.  This was not Bellingham's best night as Dortmund's Champions League campaign came to an end with the added disappointment of squandering a first-leg lead, but the 19-year-old still showed why he will be in such demand.  Bellingham's night had low points, such as when he poked a great chance wide from eight yards in the second half and a very poor challenge in the closing seconds that left Reece James prostrate and brought a yellow card.  He did, however, show class and arrogance on the ball, vision, and a marauding style as Dortmund chased an equaliser in vain after Chelsea grabbed control.  Bellingham trooped off at the final whistle and is likely to be playing his Champions League football elsewhere next season, but in little flashes he still showed what all the fuss is about.

{"title": "Real Madrid 2-0 Chelsea: Blues' Champions League ambitions dented by the holders", "content": "1230 Chelsea have it all to do if they are to advance to the Champions League semi-finals after losing to holders Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Karim Benzema's tap-in - his 90th goal in the competition - gave Real boss Carlo Ancelotti the perfect start against his former club. Real Madrid struggled to add to their lead before Ben Chilwell was shown a straight red card in the 59th minute for fouling Rodrygo as the Brazil forward threatened to go clean through on goal. Chelsea produced a battling performance but Real scored what could be a decisive second goal when substitute Marco Asensio finished well after the visitors were caught out following a short corner. Chelsea carried more of an attacking threat after the tepid performance against Wolves in Frank Lampard's first game back as interim manager, and had chances of their own. Joao Felix forced Thibaut Courtois into a smart save when the game was goalless before the former Chelsea keeper produced a fine diving stop to deny Raheem Sterling an equaliser. Chelsea must score at least twice in next Tuesday's quarter-final return leg at Stamford Bridge, but they are now without a goal in their past four matches. They were denied a late strike when former Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger produced a superb block to deny substitute Mason Mount a goal that would have sent the Blues into the second leg in high spirits. The Champions League is their last hope of a trophy in this most chaotic of seasons and Felix almost gave the Blues a dream start in the second minute, only to be denied by Courtois. While Real struggled at times for rhythm in midfield, the return of N'Golo Kante improved Chelsea's engine room, while Felix continued to keep Courtois on his toes before he was replaced after Chilwell was sent off in the 59th minute. Chelsea owner Todd Boehly said in an interview with Sky Sports before the game that \"we're excited about the future\" while also predicting his club would win 3-0 against Real Madrid. It is hard to see where the excitement is coming from after a fifth game without a win and the team drifting in the bottom half of the Premier League table. This was Chelsea's ninth Champions League game of the season with their third different manager.  Since Ancelotti was sacked by the Blues in May 2011 after finishing second in the table, Chelsea have gone through 10 permanent managers - sacking seven, including Lampard in January 2021. Lampard had been due to work at this game as a television pundit until he answered Chelsea's call to take charge until the end of the season.  The club legend, however, has now suffered 13 defeats in his past 16 matches in all competitions across spells with Everton and Chelsea this season. Ancelotti said on the eve of this tie that he was \"sad\" about Chelsea's poor form yet his Real Madrid side added to his former club's problems. Real were far from their fluid best but did enough to establish a healthy advantage as they look to win the competition for a record 15th time. Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo were a handful as Real registered 18 attempts, while Courtois was a solid last line of defence. Rudiger's block to deny Mount at the end was crucial. Having helped Chelsea win the Champions League in 2021, the German showed what a shrewd addition he is after moving to Real on a free transfer last June.

{"title": "Benfica 5-1 Club Bruges (agg 7-1): Scott Parker unsure of future after defeat", "content": "187 Scott Parker says he is \"not sure\" he will still be Club Bruges boss following Tuesday's thrashing at Benfica that eliminated the Belgians from the Champions League. The former Bournemouth and Fulham manager faced a difficult task to overturn a 2-0 loss from the first leg. But he perhaps could not have anticipated such a heavy defeat as they conceded five goals in Portugal for a 7-1 defeat on aggregate. Parker becomes the first English manager to concede five goals in a Champions League match and, with Club Bruges having won just two games since his appointment at the end of December, he accepts his future is out of his hands. Asked if he will still be manager for Sunday's league game against Standard Liege, he told BT Sport: \"I am not sure. I am not in control of that. \"I understand why you are asking me that question and it has probably been aimed at me for some weeks now. \"I can't really control that. I am not in that position to understand it and you are asking probably the wrong person. What I am is fully committed in trying to turn this around and that is what I will try to do.\" Parker was  sacked by Bournemouth in August  following a 9-0 defeat by Liverpool, four games into the season. Benfica, who won the first leg 2-0, opened the scoring in the first half with a smart finish from Rafa Silva. Goncalo Ramos then showed great footwork to make it 4-0 on aggregate, before stabbing home from close range. Joao Mario's penalty and David Neres' finish wrapped up the win before Bjorn Meijer scored a stunning consolation. It is the second successive season Benfica have reached the Champions League quarter-finals, though they have never progressed further and were beaten by Liverpool at that stage last term. \"The result hits us hard,\" said Club Bruges midfielder Hans Vanaken. \"The way in which it happened was painful too, because we shipped the goals too easily. \"I am emotional because we had a great campaign. You don't want to go out like that.\" Club Bruges rarely looked like turning the tie around, with Benfica even having the ball in the net after two minutes through Joao Mario, but it was ruled out for offside. Despite that early chance, the visitors did well to hold off their opponents for 38 minutes and were starting to look threatening when Silva scored, keeping his cool to control the ball from a cross before slotting in. From then on Club Bruges capitulated as the tie looked beyond them and another fine finish, this time from Portugal forward Ramos, ended the game as a contest.  Mario's penalty came either side of clinical finishes by Ramos and Neres, but Meijer did at least give the travelling fans something to cheer with an exquisite first-time finish into the top corner. Since the Champions League was formed, Benfica have lost all five quarter-finals they have played in, but this result and performance will give them hope of taking the next step.

With Luciano Spalletti's side two goals up from the first leg, the Nigeria striker's thumping header in first-half stoppage time dispelled any lingering nerves at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Osimhen doubled the Italians' lead on the night with a close-range finish from Giovanni di Lorenzo's cross eight minutes after the break and, having been brought down in the box, Piotr Zielinski converted the penalty himself to make it 3-0. \"We want to enjoy the moment and look ahead. It's a great win, we re-wrote the history of this club,\" Osimhen said. \"We keep dreaming, we don't have limits. We follow our coach and look ahead.\" With a commanding 18-point lead at the top of Serie A, Napoli head into the last eight with a real chance to compete for top prize in European football. The build-up to the match had been overshadowed as Eintracht Frankfurt fans clashed with police after arriving in Naples despite being  banned from attending the second leg of the last-16 tie . Once the game did start, it was the visitors who had the first effort of note as Rafael Borre headed off target in the 10th minute but from there Napoli took charge. The electric Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was the main threat in the first half, slaloming through the Frankfurt defence in the 19th minute before seeing his effort from a tight angle saved by Kevin Trapp in the visitors' goal. Kvaratskhelia went close again three minutes before the break after another driving run but was again denied by Trapp. The breakthrough came on the stroke of half-time when Matteo Politano dug out a cross from the right and Osimhen powered the header back past the goalkeeper. After the break, with the tie all but settled, Napoli were able to show more of the attacking flair that has brought them such success this season and after good work from Di Lorenzo down the right, Osimhen was waiting to finish as he stretched at the far post. The goal was Napoli's 24th in this season's Champions League, taking them past Benfica as the competition's top scorers and when Djibril Sow upended Zielinski with a clumsy challenge in the box, the Polish midfielder calmly dispatched the 64th-minute spot kick to make it 25. Frankfurt did have the chance to make the game slightly more nervy before the penalty but Daichi Kamada failed to convert from inside the six yard box. As it was, Napoli were able to enjoy the last half hour as they completed the joint-largest aggregate win by an Italian side in the Champions League knockout stages to join Serie A rivals Inter and AC Milan in the quarters.

Mane will also be given a fine.\" Bild said  former Liverpool player Mane, a two-time African footballer of the year, had complained about the way Germany winger Sane spoke to him after the defeat. After flying back to Germany, Mane was picked up privately at the airport while Sane got the team bus. Both Mane and Sane were back in training together on Thursday morning. Neither player has yet commented on the alleged altercation. Bayern host City in their quarter-final second leg next Wednesday. Mane joined Bayern from Liverpool for £35m on a three-year contract in June, shortly before prolific striker Robert Lewandowski left the German champions for Barcelona. He scored six goals in his first seven matches in all competitions for Bayern but has not scored since October, struggling to replicate the Poland international's exploits. Mane, who scored 120 goals in 269 appearances for Liverpool, missed the Qatar World Cup because of a knee injury picked up while playing for Bayern in November, which also kept him out of nine club games. Sadio Mane got a little bit physical with Leroy Sane in the dressing room. It started on the pitch, they were talking about a move that broke down and things got a little bit heated. Two people, who really would know, told me Mane slapped Sane violently and busted his lip a little bit. It doesn't so much speak about the visions in the dressing room, but more to Mane's very frustrating time at Munich. He was hailed as a superstar, there was talk about him possibly winning the Ballon d'Or on the back of winning the African Cup of Nations and going to the World Cup. Of course it didn't happen because of injury and, when he's played, he hasn't quite looked like this unbelievable force of nature. Total energy, wonderful movement, strong mentality - all these things have been missing. His stats are not terribly bad so it's not a complete collapse in form, but he's not the player they thought they were signing. Not playing from the start, and being subbed on by Thomas Tuchel after also missing out on the PSG game where he was also a sub, he wasn't happy about that. There is a lot of stuff happening now in terms of his expectations and disappointments and the same goes for the club, they expected a lot more from him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65257844"},

His players, however, will have to do something they have not done in four games if they are to progress against the holders - score a goal. Chelsea suffered a second successive defeat under interim boss Lampard after finishing with 10 men following Ben Chilwell's straight red card for a foul on Rodrygo in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. It means the Blues must score at least twice at Stamford Bridge in next Tuesday's return leg. \"Special things can happen at Stamford Bridge,\" said Lampard, who has now suffered 13 defeats in his last 16 matches as manager in all competitions across spells with Everton and Chelsea this season.   \"We have to believe.\" Chelsea have failed to score in four consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since November/December 1993.  Since drawing 2-2 at home to Everton on 18 March before Graham Potter was sacked, the Blues have lost 2-0 at home to Aston Villa, drawn 0-0 with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge and lost 1-0 at Wolves, before Wednesday's defeat by Real. They have failed to score in 17 games this season, their most since 1994-95 (also 17). Lampard's side registered seven attempts at the Bernabeu of which three were on target. Former Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois produced a fine save to deny Raheem Sterling an equaliser before ex-Blues defender Antonio Rudiger's block frustrated Mason Mount right at the end. Lampard, who returned to take charge last week until the end of the season, said after the game that his side is suffering from a lack of belief. However, he remains confident his players can turn it around at Stamford Bridge against Real Madrid. Pressed about his side's lack of goals, Lampard added: \"Sometimes it is confidence, whether that is an individual thing or team confidence. \"If you keep working, something can change. Take Mason Mount's chance at the end, it might go in and the tie feels completely different.  \"The door is open. It's up to us to kick it open. \"There's a bit of a lack of belief. The players don't know how good they are. There was some good in there. Next week will be a big fight. \"There are some details and mindset stuff, we have to be more positive. If we do that...

That is embarrassing for Chelsea.\" Mario Melchiot, an FA Cup winner with Chelsea in 2000, said the team was crying out for a new striker. \"Chelsea have great talent in the team, they all have ability,\" he told 5 Live. \"They need a striker but those guys playing at the moment need to show more desire to get goals.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65259080"},
{"title": "Real Madrid v Manchester City: 'Pep Guardiola's side cannot afford to switch off'", "content": "\"Don't make a mistake.\" That's what the Manchester City players will be thinking to themselves when they face Real Madrid on Tuesday, and they cannot afford to switch off for a single second. I was working at Leicester's crucial game against Everton last week and the match analysts for both clubs were sitting next to me. I said \"look lads, put your monitors down - it's not about tactics tonight, it is just about avoiding any errors\".   That was a Premier League relegation battle while this is a Champions League semi-final, but City versus Real is exactly the same scenario, just at a much higher level. You can give players all the data you've got, and detailed instructions for how to play a particular role or deal with a certain opponent. All of that is important, of course, but they also know that if they suffer one lapse in concentration then the game has changed, and maybe even been lost. That's what happened to City when they played Real in last season's semi-final. They were in full control of the tie heading into the 90th minute of the second leg…  and they still didn't go through. We know this Real team can score a goal out of nothing and, especially in the first leg at the Bernabeu, City have to be extremely careful.  The first game  was very open  when they met last year but, this time, we might see City start out by trying to be tighter defensively. That means keeping Vinicius Jr quiet and I think the two big decisions Pep Guardiola has to make are who will go up against the Brazil winger on the right for City, and who will play further forward on the same flank. The choice in defence is really between Kyle Walker and Manuel Akanji, but if Nathan Ake does not recover from the injury he sustained against Leeds on Saturday then it is possible Pep's mind will be made up for him. He could go with the experience of Aymeric Laporte at left-back but I have a feeling he will pick Akanji because of how well he did against Bukayo Saka when he played there in last month's  4-1 win over Arsenal. Ake did not train with the rest of the City team on Monday but, if he is fit, Guardiola has more options. He could use John Stones in his inverted full-back role, where he comes inside from right-back to become an extra man in central midfield, leaving Akanji to move out wide to the right to deal with Vinicius. I think Guardiola would love to use that system at some point against Real, but he will be worried about their threat on the counter through Vinicius. Walker's speed is the obvious way to deal with that and, as a natural full-back, I feel he has to be the answer there, whether Akanji is needed to cover for Ake or not. Akanji has been incredible since joining from Borussia Dortmund last summer and, at just £15m, has to go down as the bargain signing of this season.  He deserves to play somewhere in City's backline against Real but that is irrelevant because all Pep will consider is who is best suited for this specific game. And when you are facing one of the most dangerous wide players in the world, why would you put a centre-back in that position when you have Walker, who is made for the job? It's not just Walker's pace that makes him perfect, it's his power and his understanding of how to deal with the problems Vinicius poses, which he has picked up by playing in so many huge games in the past. Walker's presence would be important psychologically too. From Vinicius's point of view, who would he prefer to face - a centre-back coming out wide, who is not as quick as him... or someone who he knows he cannot outrun? Stopping Real is not just down to the defenders, though. It starts from the front. If City pick Erling Haaland to lead the line, and it is pretty obvious they will, then he is not the best at pressing - they will need other players who provide that. That makes me think Guardiola will go with Bernardo Silva over Riyad Mahrez on the right because, although Pep likes to have one quicker attacker in European away games, Bernardo will give the team more legs with his work-rate to press when they are out of possession. It is that flank where Real are most dangerous, through Vinicius, so if you put Bernardo in front, then he can double up with whoever his right-back is. Bernardo will play somewhere, I am sure. City will need his work-rate whether it is out on the right or in the centre of midfield alongside Rodri and Kevin de Bruyne. I am expecting City to dominate possession but they will have to press Real in the middle of the pitch, where they might be outnumbered, because that is another area where the holders can do some serious damage. City have to try to screen Karim Benzema and stop passes being played into him, but that is made more difficult by the fact he is constantly on the move and happy to get on the ball anywhere. When Rodri was asked about Benzema last year he talked about how the Frenchman does not just score goals, he also makes Real feel more comfortable in possession. His movement is brilliant so they know they can always find him, and usually in space. One of the City centre-halves will have to stay tight on him when he comes deeper to collect those passes, and looks to flick balls over the press and find runners like Vinicius. That will be another constant danger in Spain and also in the second leg at Etihad Stadium next week. City could win out there and still find it tough to finish the job and, to get through to the final, it feels like they will need to have everything going for them. I don't think anyone will be saying the tie is over, whatever the score is after the first leg.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65525175"},
{"title": "Real Madrid v Manchester City: How Erling Haaland became a footballing phenomenon", "content": "Where to begin with the phenomenon that is Erling Haaland? The Norwegian 22-year-old has already scored more goals in a Premier League season than anyone before him and is just the second player in English top-flight history to net more than 50 times in all competitions - and the first for 95 years.  All this with a potential eight games left in the campaign, and in his debut Premier League season after his move to Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund for an initial £51.2m last summer. Haaland's prolific exploits have helped the champions back to the top of the league table and eyeing a Treble, with an FA Cup final and two Champions League semi-finals against Real Madrid on the horizon. Haaland and Co will visit the Bernabeu on Tuesday for the first leg against the European champions full of confidence this can be their year. Not since managing Lionel Messi at Barcelona has Pep Guardiola's approach been influenced more by the presence of just one player, but the frightening thing for the rest of Europe is Haaland's best could be yet to come. So how did he get to be the player he is today? Born in Leeds in 2000, the son of former Nottingham Forest, Leeds and Manchester City defender Alf-Inge Haaland and heptathlete Gry Marita Braut seemed destined for a successful sports career from an early age. In 2006, he achieved a world record in his age category for the standing long jump with a jump of 1.63 metres. He was five years old. At youth level - having moved back to his parents' Norwegian hometown of Bryne aged three - he was a skinny, fast and incredibly dedicated winger. And even then Haaland was a passionate student of the game, looking to the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robin van Persie, Jamie Vardy, Messi and Mario Balotelli for inspiration. After monitoring his older brother Astor closely - and increasing the pressure on him to make it as a professional athlete, which didn't happen - Haaland's parents took a more relaxed approach with the younger sibling. They allowed Erling to develop more naturally and, as he grew in confidence, he did as well in size and stature at Byrne, his boyhood club where he came through the academy. Now an imposing 6ft 4ins centre-forward, Haaland's growth spurt in his mid-teens - which brought the inevitable pains - brought a physique that married well with the attributes he already had to become a professional footballer; technical ability, tactical nous and the right mentality.  \"I do the same runs as I did as a 13-year-old,\" he says. Coach Alf-Ingve Berntsen, who trained him for eight years at Bryne, said: \"At 13 years old, I already saw that this kid was going to make the Norwegian national team with his very special work ethic and tactical sense.\" A spell at Molde between 2017-19 under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who dedicated hours to Haaland on a one-to-one basis, helped him develop as a finisher because at that time it was something that did not come naturally to him.  Once it became clear he wanted to be a professional, a five-year strategic plan was prepared by him and his father, which included two years at Molde refining the finer points of his game and playing as many matches as possible. The goals flowed - as did the interest from elsewhere. Haaland moved to Red Bull Salzburg in 2019, scoring 25 goals in 23 matches including a 45-minute hat-trick in his Champions League debut against Genk which served as conclusive proof he belonged at that level. From there, he moved to Borussia Dortmund for about 20m euros. Despite serious interest from the likes of Manchester United and Juventus, the forward chose the German club with an eye on the amount of playing time he would get there. Starting with a 23-minute hat-trick on his debut as a second-half substitute, Haaland scored 86 goals in 89 appearances at Dortmund. It was only a matter of time before he would join one of the biggest clubs in the world - with Manchester City activating his 60m euro (£51.2 million) release clause last summer. Haaland will be just 26 when his five-year deal comes to an end and many expect him to try his trade in Spain and Italy next, with his desire to succeed in the biggest leagues in the world. Even Haaland himself is a little surprised by how well he has done so quickly at Etihad Stadium. One of the key reasons for his success has been his trainer, Ivar Eggja, who works closely with his father and acts as a 'facilitator' for the striker - finding him a home, looking after his diet and giving him everything he needs so he only thinks about football. By the time Haaland arrived in Manchester, he already had everything in place. Another key is the fact he is never satisfied - always looking to improve. Manchester City's Italian trainer Mario Pafundi pushes him but also helps him understand his body. This has meant Haaland has so far avoided the injuries that set him back him last year at Borussia Dortmund. He has gained around 12kg of muscle in the past 15 months as a result of privileged genetics, a regime involving the consumption of enormous quantities of quality food, coupled with hugely demanding training circuits and a relaxed life style incorporating periods of meditation which he uses to ensure his mind is in the right place. There were questions around how Haaland would fit in to Manchester City's style of play, whose power comes from the midfield, cutting through the lines and creating space behind the opposition defence, while the Norwegian's strengths are in the rapid transitions. City's style of play when more measured can create a disconnect between Haaland up front and the rest of the team, something Guardiola is aware of and keen to avoid. After the defeat at Manchester United in January, the City boss admitted the whole side had to get the striker more involved. Haaland was a peripheral figure having only a couple of half-chances and just 19 touches in the match. The challenge for Guardiola is to play the type of game he wants, while still ensuring Haaland is engaged, occupied, fully focused and generally happy, even if that means occasionally putting in a pass that you wouldn't normally consider. The coaching staff have on occasions asked Kevin de Bruyne or Bernardo Silva to put balls through to Haaland that they would not normally play for no other reason other than to ensure he stays fully connected with proceedings. He still feels frustrated on occasions when he does not get the service his runs are calling for, while he also knows he could be more helpful to team-mates in and around the box and off the ball. \"Haaland lives 24 hours for his profession, his work, his passion, what he loves,\" said Guardiola. Those that know him talk of someone who is polite, humble, grounded and self-assured - certainly not someone who is egotistical or arrogant. Fanatical as a trainer and invariably the first to arrive and the last to leave, Haaland is aware of the need to immerse himself in the necessary rigours required. This includes extensive massages and ice baths, all lessons he has learned from his father's schooling. Invariably positive, upbeat and smiling, he loves Italian food, Italian wine, eating well and has little time for social media. He doesn't read what is written about him because he realises it is pointless trying to control those things you are unable to. He has the right amount of confidence in himself and tries to thrive off the pressure that comes with the territory. To help him cope with that pressure, he is passionate about the powers of meditation and its ability to remove stress from his life and also conscious of the need for good quality sleep. He is not a night bird, nor a big video game or film buff, preferring instead - when not training - to live a quiet life at home, relaxing. One of Haaland's great strengths is his ability to shed self-doubt. He is one of the most intensely watched and highest-paid athletes in the world, and he just rolls with it, as if he doesn't even notice. He is not afraid of making mistakes and is unfailingly positive in the knowledge that even if he does not get it right he will always get another chance, and another, and another. He is not the sort of person to dwell on past misfortunes. Haaland is certainly aware that as huge a talent as he is, he is still a work in progress, which is a frightening prospect for the rest of the world.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65494495"},
{"title": "Champions League semi-finals: Vote for your favourite classic last four tie", "content": "Champions League semi-finals - where the unthinkable occurs. From late goals to the impossible comeback, and the occasional red card, BBC Sport has taken a look back at some of the most remarkable ties of recent years and it is up to you to choose which is the best of the best. So what are you waiting for? Read below and get voting.  Karim Benzema, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Kevin de Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden A thrilling first leg at Etihad Stadium saw Pep Guardiola overcome his old rivals on his most recent pursuit of Champions League glory. His side battled with Real Madrid to take a 4-3 lead into the second leg.  In a game which was not short of chances, Riyad Mahrez extended City's advantage at the Bernabeu to leave Carlo Ancelotti's men needing two goals just to take the tie to extra time.  Substitute Rodrygo kick-started an incredible turnaround, putting two efforts past Ederson in as many minutes right at the end of normal time. To Manchester City's disbelief they now had to put up with a fully enthused Madrid side, who managed to grab a place in the Champions League final thanks to a 95th-minute penalty from Karim Benzema. Pure drama.  Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho, Gerard Pique, Divock Origi, Sadio Mane, Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold Finalists the previous year, Jurgen Klopp's side looked as though they were heading out after a goal from Luis Suarez and a Lionel Messi double - including a dream free-kick - condemned them to a 3-0 first-leg loss at the Nou Camp. Liverpool needed a second-leg miracle. Usual starters Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were missing - but up stepped Divock Origi. The striker pulled one back in the first 10 minutes and, as belief rose inside a fervent Anfield, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum popped up with two goals in two minutes to level the tie. Rarely have you seen Barcelona so rattled. Messi was as anonymous as he was omnipresent just a week earlier, and when Origi swept in Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick corner with 11 minutes left the incredible had become reality.  Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Cristian Eriksen, Donny van de Beek, Dusan Tadic, Hakim Ziyech, Matthijs de Ligt Ajax had been the breakout side of 2018-19, beating Real Madrid and Juventus to set up a tie with Tottenham. So it was perhaps no surprise when they left London with a 1-0 lead. In Amsterdam things went from bad to worse for Tottenham. With no Harry Kane up front, they were facing a mountain to climb when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech made it 3-0 on aggregate before half-time. Lucas Moura inspired a magnificent comeback. The forward scored twice in the space of four minutes to leave the visitors needing one goal to go through, and after Jan Vertonghen had headed against the post, Moura's low drive completed his hat-trick to give his side victory on the away goals rule and set up an all-English final against Liverpool.  Robert Lewandowski, Marco Reus, Mario Gotze, Mats Hummels, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mesut Ozil, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos This was the first year Jurgen Klopp came to the attention of many in the UK, with Borussia Dortmund scoring twice in added time to beat Malaga in the previous round. Still, they weren't fancied to pull up too many trees against Real Madrid, but produced a remarkable first-leg display at the Westfalenstadion. Robert Lewandowski - who would leave a year later for free - scored four times as Real were routed 4-1. The Polish forward was too mobile for Pepe and Sergio Ramos, scoring a second-half treble in front of the yellow wall. Real needed a 3-0 win in the second leg to go through but a fine performance from Klopp's men looked to have done enough. However, two goals in the last 10 minutes, from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, ensured a nervy finale as Dortmund just about hung on.  Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Ramires, John Terry, Lionel Messi, Alexis Sanchez, Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta The first leg at Stamford Bridge saw Barcelona come close, but it was Chelsea, through Didier Drogba, who edged ahead 1-0.  Back to the Nou Camp and it was the anchorman Sergio Busquets who popped up with a tap-in to level the aggregate scores. It was one-way traffic and soon Chelsea were seriously up against it when captain John Terry saw red for a knee in the back of Alexis Sanchez.  Messi then teed up Andres Iniesta to make it 2-1 on aggregate and Chelsea needed a goal. Ramires was the unlikely man to find it, a superb finish to chip Victor Valdes - all of this before half-time. Lionel Messi then missed a penalty, planting it against the crossbar, before Barcelona, facing defeat on away goals, were caught on the break. Fernando Torres had the whole half to run into, rounded Valdes and rolled in to cap a remarkable win.  Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, John Terry, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba After a goalless draw at the Nou Camp, Chelsea were on course for a second straight final when Michael Essien scored one of the great forgotten goals, a 25-yard volley which smashed in off the underside of the crossbar. Chelsea felt they should have had four penalties, and even their staunchest critics would have to concede that they should have had at least one, most obviously for a handball from Gerard Pique. Referee Tom Henning Ovrebo said no - although he did send off Eric Abidal - and deep into added time Andres Iniesta scored superbly from Lionel Messi's pass. Chelsea couldn't believe it - remember Didier Drogba's \"disgrace\" rant straight down the camera? - but Barca advanced on away goals to play Manchester United in the final.  Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, John Terry, Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso, Steven Gerrard Chelsea came up against their previous semi-final rivals Liverpool, who knocked them out in the last four in both 2004-05 and 2006-07.  In a cagey first leg, Liverpool had a one-goal lead thanks to a close-range shot from Dirk Kuyt. However, Chelsea were offered a lifeline in the dying minutes as John Arne Riise nodded a clearing header into his own net.  At Stamford Bridge, Didier Drogba gave the Blues the lead in the opening half but opposing forward Fernando Torres levelled after the break.  Extra time was needed and Frank Lampard converted a penalty to put Chelsea 3-2 ahead on aggregate before Drogba stepped up again to score his second of the night. Ryan Babel's audacious effort reduced the deficit but it was not enough and Liverpool would not make another semi-final until 2017-18.  Kaka, Clarence Seedorf, Paolo Maldini, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney A fantastic start to the tie for Manchester United saw Cristiano Ronaldo put them ahead in the first 10 minutes.  But then Kaka entered the scene. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner collected a pass and glided past United with ease before planting a fine low shot into the far corner.  It was a Kaka masterclass and the Brazilian added a beautiful solo goal with his flair too much for United defenders Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra.  Wayne Rooney did get a leveller and then powered in a superb shot from long range in stoppage time to give United a slender 3-2 lead at the halfway stage of the tie. At the San Siro, it was Kaka once again who proved the difference and his delicious left-footed drive put Milan back ahead on away goals early on.  Clarence Seedorf then beat Edwin van der Sar from the edge of the area and Alberto Gilardino provided the coup de grace.  Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Gianluigi Buffon, Lilian Thuram, Pavel Nedved, Alessandro del Piero, David Trezeguet The first leg was in Madrid and Ronaldo opened the scoring with a superb finish from the edge of the area. Juventus grabbed an away goal on the stroke of half-time when David Trezeguet stabbed in a deflected shot from Alessandro del Piero.   Real were back in front when Roberto Carlos' piledriver went through a sea of players and it was on to Turin.  Trezeguet spurred Juve's second-leg comeback as his close-range effort put the home side ahead on away goals. Real needed a goal, on came Ronaldo, and he won a penalty with a trademark body-swerve. Up stepped Luis Figo, but Gianluigi Buffon saved his spot-kick.  It was the key moment as within five minutes Pavel Nedved had outpaced Fernando Hierro to fire in, and while Zinedine Zidane scored against his old team, it was too late.  Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Roy Keane, Dwight Yorke, Zinedine Zidane, Antonio Conte, Edgar Davids, Filippo Inzaghi The 1999 Treble win for Manchester United is etched into the public consciousness, even if the final against Bayern Munich was largely quite dull - until the incredible finale. The two-legged semi-final against Juventus was dramatic from start to finish. The first leg at Old Trafford saw future Chelsea boss Antonio Conte strike the Italian giants into an early lead before a second-half United siege finally bore fruit when Ryan Giggs hammered into the roof of the net in the last minute. With the tie all square at 1-1, Juve were favourites in the second leg, even more so when Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Game over? Nobody told Roy Keane. His header gave United hope and he led by example throughout, despite picking up a yellow card that would rule him out of the final. Dwight Yorke headed United level on the night - and ahead on away goals - before half-time in this classic encounter. Inzaghi had a hat-trick 'goal' correctly ruled out for offside, before Andrew Cole tapped in to seal a famous win for United.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65390327"},
{"title": "Champions League: AEK Athens-Dinamo Zagreb qualifier postponed after fan killed", "content": "Tuesday's Champions League qualifier between AEK Athens and Dinamo Zagreb has been postponed after a fan was stabbed to death in the Greek capital. The Greek supporter, 29, died following brawls between rival fans outside AEK's Agia Sophia Stadium in a northern suburb of Athens on Monday evening. Police said eight others were injured  and 98 arrests were made. Uefa had banned visiting supporters from both legs of the third-round qualifying tie over security concerns. European football's governing body said that the trouble meant the match had to be postponed, with the decision made in consultation with the local authorities.  \"Uefa deplores in the strongest possible terms the appalling incidents that took place in Athens last night and resulted in the loss of a life,\" Uefa said. \"While expressing our deepest sympathy to the family of the victim, to AEK Athens FC and its fans, we would like to reiterate that violence has no place in our sport and we expect that those responsible for this terrible act be arrested and consigned to justice in the shortest delay.\" The return leg in Croatia will go ahead as planned next Tuesday,15 August with the game in Athens to take place on Saturday, 19 August. Greek police said the trouble started 90 minutes after Croatian side Dinamo had completed a pre-match training session at the stadium in Nea Philadelphia and left under police escort. Between 100-120 Dinamo fans showed up to the stadium and clashed with AEK fans who had gathered there.  Fans from both sides \"threw flares, improvised incendiary devices, objects, stones, and also used improvised bats\". Police said a preliminary investigation had started and they were trying to identify the perpetrators. \"GNK Dinamo strongly condemns the riots that took place last night in Athens,\" a  Dinamo Zagreb statement  said.  \"Such events are not in line with the values ​​and ethics we promote as a club and community. \"We express our deep concern over this incident. GNK Dinamo would like to express its sincere condolences to the family of the deceased.\" Hooliganism has marred Greek football in recent years and last year the government increased the maximum sentence for crimes of fan violence from six months to five years after another fatal stabbing. Alkis Kampanos, 19, was  killed in February 2022  in Thessaloniki during a fight between supporters of the city's rival clubs Aris and PAOK. Last month, seven defendants were found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life in prison. Five others received sentences of more than 19 years for complicity.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66437694"},
{"title": "Mauricio Pochettino: Chelsea appointment could be defining moment of new era", "content": "768 Mauricio Pochettino's appointment as Chelsea manager may come to be viewed as the defining moment of the post-Roman Abramovich era.  To say the first 12 months of co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali have been underwhelming - and underwhelming to the tune of £600m - would be a masterpiece of understatement.  The Clearlake group marked their 100th day in charge by  sacking Chelsea's Champions League-winning manager Thomas Tuchel  while the promises of long-term faith and a time-honoured project  under successor Graham Potter lasted 31 games. In that time, Chelsea have torched vast sums of transfer cash  without any apparent strategy or structure,  acquisitions seemingly made on a whim or at the first sign of interest from Premier League rivals, with the spree accompanied by a failure to sign a striker who can score goals.  Club legend Frank Lampard has conducted a less-than-successful holding operation in which they went out of the Champions League to Real Madrid and suffered top-flight losses that left them lurching in mid-table and out of European competition. Not that this should be laid at Lampard's door. The damage was already done. The bounce of his return was a flatline.  Goodwill has also been evaporating, with Boehly a target for angry fans, while his dressing-room visit after the loss to Brighton last month - in which he labelled the season \"embarrassing\" - was a hindrance rather than a help, demonstrating a lack of self-awareness.  Yes, Chelsea's season has been embarrassing but Boehly has more than played his part in that.  And this is why Pochettino's appointment means so much to Chelsea, Boehly and his cohorts.  The law of averages suggests, after getting so many decisions wrong, they are scheduled to get one right and must hope the arrival of the highly regarded former Spurs manager is exactly that.  Boehly will hope it is third time lucky with Chelsea managers because, with Arsenal and Newcastle very much part of the equation at the top end of the table now, there are new battles to go beside the old rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. Tottenham, for all their recent troubles, will also have hopes of improvement under their next manager.  Chelsea, so long in pursuit of the big prizes both at home and in Europe, cannot afford to fall further behind given the stakes are so high following their financial outlay.  It has been said before, but this is one decision that must land on target.  And in Pochettino, if he is given the right conditions, Boehly may just have the man to at least fashion the vast band of new players who have arrived in west London into something resembling a shape.  The Argentine has a fine reputation in England from his work at Spurs and is charismatic enough to ensure the large majority of Chelsea fans will not only set aside his previous connections with their rivals but welcome him.  Many Spurs fans wanted their former boss - who was sacked by Daniel Levy in November 2019, six months after reaching the Champions League final - back in north London, but that has never been on the cards.  Pochettino, whose high pressing and attractive style of play has always won plaudits, will also want to prove he can win trophies in England after securing the Ligue 1 title and French Cup during his spell at Paris St-Germain.  This was always the question placed against Pochettino at Spurs. He made them contenders but could never make them winners. Chelsea will not be satisfied with that and nor, it should be stressed, will he.  Chelsea and Boehly need their new manager to work fast after a dreadful season that posed justifiable questions about the owners' competence and knowledge of how football works.  Pochettino looks the perfect fit and will benefit from the fact he joins with the bar having been set so low - the usual sky-high expectations at Chelsea diluted, for now at least, by their painful fall from grace.   He has a personality and man-management skills that make players warm to him, especially young players who revel under his guidance, while he also renewed the Spurs squad after succeeding Tim Sherwood in May 2014.  This should not be mistaken for a lack of ruthlessness, as Chelsea's players will find out if they do not meet the demands, both in the footballing and physical context, of Pochettino and his trusted assistant Jesus Perez.  Chelsea can also be confident he will have none of the credibility problems, unfair or otherwise, that provided a backdrop to Potter's tenure, when the Englishman failed to convince supporters he was the right profile to manage this dysfunctional giant of a club having arrived from Brighton.  Boehly would do well to listen to Pochettino's Premier League experiences and be guided by his manager given the ownership's own theories have been shot to pieces by the evidence of their first campaign at the helm.  For all the scattergun nature of Chelsea's transfer spree, during which a Frankenstein's monster of a squad has been assembled, good players have undoubtedly arrived  such as £107m Argentina World Cup winner Enzo Fernandez  - and there are raw materials to work with.  Pochettino has proved adept in that, but now Boehly and co must step back and let Pochettino make those key decisions on who stays, who goes, and who arrives. He also has reserves of home-grown talent to work with, which he will relish.  It is time for Chelsea's owners to reduce their profile.  And if their decision to bring in Pochettino, fuelled and motivated by his time away, is a success it might just help them achieve that.  One thing is certain - Chelsea's owners cannot afford another failure. ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65386958"},
{"title": "Real Madrid 1-1 Man City: 'If Erling Haaland doesn't get you, Kevin de Bruyne will'", "content": "529 Real Madrid may be the greatest and most ruthless exponents of Champions League football but even they could not escape the reality that if Erling Haaland does not get you, then there is every chance Kevin de Bruyne will.  Haaland has been Manchester City's headline act this season with 51 goals but De Bruyne remains the brilliant football brain behind this operation on the pitch, proving it again to give Pep Guardiola's side a very creditable  1-1 draw in Champions League semi-final first leg at the Bernabeu.  There will be no more than quiet satisfaction in the City camp, though, after a job well done against the holders.  City know from painful experience how dangerous Real are at any point in a two-legged tie - just look at the same stage at the same venue last season when the Spanish side scored twice in stoppage time to level the scores and pave a path to ultimate victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.  Carlo Ancelotti and his potent blend of youth and vast experience will still back themselves at Etihad Stadium in the return leg.  The joy for City and frustration for Real is that the Spaniards believed they had got the most difficult part right by keeping Haaland quiet, the Norwegian striker having only 21 touches on a night when he was peripheral, mainly through a combination of Antonio Rudiger's physical presence and a superb saving tackle from David Alaba.  Not enough. Not with De Bruyne working his magic.  It was Haaland who dominated all the headlines Madrid in the build-up, with one reading \"Viene el Ogro\" (The Ogre Is Coming). Instead, it was Belgium midfielder De Bruyne, so often Haaland's creator this season, who stepped up to leave this tie delicately balanced.  City were under pressure - rather like Real were when Vinicius Junior fired a long-range rocket past Ederson in the 36th minute for the opener - as De Bruyne took possession midway through the second half and struck a right-foot shot from 25 yards that was rattling off the back of the net before even a goalkeeper of Thibaut Courtois' quality could intervene.  It was another special moment from a special player. De Bruyne is such a class act, and does it all with such apparent ease, that there is almost a danger he may not be fully appreciated outside Manchester City.  De Bruyne is a big player delivering on the big stage and City were thankful for his inspiration because it came as Real appeared to be up to their old trick of looking all at sea for the early stage of a major game before going on to win it.  City carried some psychological baggage into the Bernabeu after that traumatic 6-5 semi-final loss last season when they somehow fashioned defeat from victory.  They will now feel a measure of confidence about reaching their second Champions League final and securing their first win against either AC Milan or Inter Milan.  It will be a confidence heavily laced with caution, however, because only a fool would ever back with certainty against a Real Madrid team with such form for squeezing themselves out of the tightest situations and getting the job done.  City will have home advantage and are on a 21-match unbeaten run as they aim to replicate Manchester United's 1999 Treble season when their city rivals won the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.  And they can feel real satisfaction at much of their performance in Madrid, from the domination of the early stages to how they managed the closing phase, although it needed a fine Ederson save to divert away substitute Aurelien Tchouameni's powerful late effort.  The equation sounds simple. Win and off to Istanbul for the final.   It is just not quite as simple as that when the obstacle is a battle-hardened and streetwise Real Madrid marshalled by the tournament's greatest coach, the four-time winner Ancelotti.  All City's plans will be placed in this context. They are in a good position but they will confront a group of players and coach who simply believe winning the Champions League is always Real Madrid's destiny.  Haaland may yet be \"The Ogre\" on what promises to be a superb semi-final second leg at Etihad Stadium but in the Bernabeu it was De Bruyne who delivered the stunning strike that may yet haunt Real Madrid.

{"title": "Champions League draw: Newcastle face Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund & AC Milan in Group F", "content": "1985 Newcastle United will play European giants Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan in Group F of the 2023-24 Champions League. The Magpies, in the group stage for the first time since 2002-03, face three sides who have all at least reached the final in the past 16 years. Manchester United will play Bayern Munich, while holders Manchester City are in the same group as RB Leipzig. Arsenal have been paired with Sevilla and Celtic face Atletico Madrid. Group A: Bayern Munich,  FC Copenhagen, Galatasaray Group B: Sevilla,   PSV Eindhoven, RC Lens Group C: Napoli, Real Madrid, Braga, Union Berlin Group D: Benfica, Inter Milan, Salzburg, Real Sociedad Group E: Feyenoord, Atletico Madrid, Lazio,  Group F: Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan,  Group G:   RB Leipzig, Red Star Belgrade, Young Boys Group H: Barcelona, Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Royal Antwerp The group stages will run from 19 September to 13 December, with the final at Wembley on 1 June. Newcastle's long-awaited return to Europe's elite competition has been much anticipated after they finished fourth in the Premier League last season - but their draw could barely have been more difficult. Eddie Howe's side will play PSG, who reached the final in 2020, and seven-time European champions and last season's semi-finalists AC Milan in Group F. They will also play Borussia Dortmund, who won the competition in 1997 and most recently reached the final 10 years ago. The Gunners, also back in the competition for the first time since 2016-17, will face PSV Eindhoven and French club RC Lens, along with Europa League winners Sevilla in Group B. Manchester City's draw looks relatively kind by contrast, with RB Leipzig, Swiss side Young Boys and Red Star Belgrade, who won the European Cup in 1991, joining them in Group G. Manchester United have been drawn against German champions Bayern Munich in a repeat of the 1999 final, with FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray also making up Group A. Along with Atletico Madrid, Celtic will play Lazio and Dutch champions Feyenoord in Group E. Newcastle United's return to the Champions League has given them arguably the toughest group to navigate towards the knockout phase after the draw in Monaco.  Paris St Germain, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan await in Group F for Eddie Howe's side and, while this presents the toughest of tests, it also offers up the prospect of some truly special nights on Tyneside as Newcastle attempt to demonstrate their new ambitions against elite opposition.  The rest of the Premier League clubs will be cautiously optimistic of progress while Newcastle will hope a fevered atmosphere at St. James' Park will fuel their attempts to reach the last 16.  Manchester United will face England captain Harry Kane when they confront Bayern Munich but Copenhagen and Galatasaray offer a genuine opportunity for progress.  Arsenal will face European specialists and Europa League holders Sevilla but a group also containing PSV Eindhoven, convincing conquerors of Glasgow Rangers, and Lens should hold no terrors.  Holders Manchester City, meanwhile, will be overwhelming favourites to reach the last 16 and top their group, in which they will play RB Leipzig, Red Star Belgrade and Young Boys of Switzerland.

{"title": "Real Madrid 1-1 Manchester City: Kevin de Bruyne helps City draw Champions League first leg", "content": "2031 Kevin de Bruyne's screamer earned Manchester City a Champions League semi-final first-leg draw at Real Madrid to keep their dream of the Treble on track. City know any win next Wednesday at home against Madrid will send them to only their second Champions League final, against either Inter Milan or AC Milan. Pep Guardiola's side dominated the early stages at a nervy Bernabeu, with Thibaut Courtois denying De Bruyne, Rodri and Erling Haaland twice. But Vinicius Jr scored with Real's only chance of the first half, a 25-yard thunderbolt which flew past Ederson following a brilliant run by Eduardo Camavinga. Just as Real began to dominate a period of the second half, City found a way back with De Bruyne fizzing a shot from a similar distance into the bottom corner.  Aurelien Tchouameni almost gave Real, looking to extend their record tally to 15 European crowns, the lead again with another strike from range but it was well saved by Ederson. City are now unbeaten in 21 games in all competitions, a run which includes 17 wins. Seven more victories and they get the Treble (winners of league, FA Cup and Champions League titles). The Champions League is the one that has been missing for City and they are arguably the best European team of the current era never to win it.  It sounds so simple, but they just need to beat Real, who are third in La Liga, at home and then either the team fourth or fifth in Italy's Serie A in the final in Istanbul. Milan face Inter on Wednesday.  Not that Guardiola will let his players get carried away with that scenario. They lead the Premier League from Arsenal with four games to go and face Manchester United, the only English team to win the Treble, in the FA Cup final in June. Talk before the game was of revenge, with Real beating City at this stage last season in a 6-5 aggregate classic.  But, a year on, City look more grown up and almost unbeatable. This game was edgy and heated but lacked some of the chaos of last season's first leg, which ended 4-3. Guardiola knows his best team now so the days of throwing a tactical shock, which often did not work, in a game like this seem a thing of the past. They played this game as if they were at home, with Real supporters booing their relentless possession. Courtois had four saves to make in the opening 16 minutes alone. But then they trailed to Vinicius' goal - with the Brazilian also scoring against City last year. However their heads did not drop, and their three-month unbeaten run continues thanks to De Bruyne. Ilkay Gundogan laid the ball off for De Bruyne, who thrashed a shot past his Belgium team-mate Courtois. Having also netted in 2020, De Bruyne is the first player in Champions League history to score in separate away games against Real in the knockout stages. City - who did not make any substitutions - never had a chance to win the game, with that their last shot. Next week they will hope to see 51-goal Haaland get more joy in front of goal. Madrid's aura in the Champions League is something special. They are not the defending champions - and 14-time winners - by accident. Domestically they sit 14 points behind champions elect Barcelona, with Atletico Madrid also above them. But they have won five Champions League titles in nine years, with two of them coming in seasons they finished third. Carlo Ancelotti's side came into this game on a good bit of domestic news, having won the Copa del Rey final against Osasuna on Saturday. But this is where Real thrive - often against English clubs too. This is the sixth knockout tie in a row in which they have faced an English team - and they have won the other five. The first half was a smash and grab to some extent with Vinicius' goal coming from their first real attack. Only Haaland (13 - 12 goals, one assist) has been involved in more Champions League goals than Vinicius this season (12 - seven goals, five assists). They grew into the game in the second half, with De Bruyne giving them a taste of their own medicine by scoring after the end of a good spell for Real.  Camavinga, who set up their goal, gave the ball away to Rodri in the build-up, highlighting the pros and cons of playing a central midfielder at left-back. Madrid boss Ancelotti was booked for his angry reaction to the goal, claiming the ball went out of play in the build-up. His side had chances to win the game with Benzema's header saved by Ederson, before French sub Tchouameni went close.

The Belgian league runners up were favourites with home advantage after last week's 1-1 draw in Geneva. Enzo Crivelli's third-minute dismissal further boosted Genk's chances. A Mike Tresor penalty and Tolu Arokodare header twice had Genk in the lead, but replies from Timothe Cognat and Chris Bedia forced extra time. Sevette scored all four of their spot kicks as Patrick Hrosovsky and Arokodare missed theirs to secure the Swiss league runners-up a place in the third qualifying round and a visit to Ibrox for the first leg on Wednesday. It looked bleak for Rene Weiler's visitors when a VAR check upgraded French forward Crivelli's yellow card to red for a challenge on midfielder Bryan Heynen that led to the Genk captain being taken off on a stretcher. Their chances were dented further when Serbian referee Novak Simovic blew for a spot kick just before the half-hour mark and Belgium midfielder Tresor fired Genk ahead. Servette levelled eight minutes later through Cognat's deflected free-kick. However, moments after being denied by the woodwork, Nigerian striker Arokodare added to his first-leg opener by heading in from Tresor's corner six minutes after the break. Servette, though, were level once more just past the hour mark, with French midfielder Cognat involved in the build-up that led to Ivory Coast Under-23 striker Bedia's close-range equaliser. That came shortly after the visitors had to replace Jeremy Frick with Joell Mall after the goalkeeper was injured blocking a shot from Bilal El Khannous. Servette also had Swiss midfielder Alexis Antunes carried off 15 minutes from the end of normal time, but they held out to win a bruising battle. Rangers have never faced Servette in European competition, but they have played a total of eight games against Swiss opponents - Young Boys, FC Zurich and Grasshopper Zurich - winning two ties and losing three.

Pep Guardiola's side are joined by Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle from the Premier League, with the latter making their return after a 20-year absence. Scottish champions Celtic are playing in the group stage for the second successive season. Here's all the key information about the 2023-24 Champions League. Newcastle have been drawn in a tricky Group F alongside French champions Paris St-Germain, Italian giants AC Milan and former Champions League winners Borussia Dortmund. City will fancy their chances of qualifying from Group G with little difficulty as they face RB Leipzig, Red Star Belgrade and Young Boys. Celtic have what appears on paper to be a favourable group featuring Feyenoord, Atletico Madrid and Lazio. The obvious concern for United are German giants Bayern Munich. But, with FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray also in Group A, United will feel they have enough to go through. Arsenal are up against Europa League winners Sevilla, PSV Eindhoven and Lens. For years, the prospect of seeing Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi on European club football's greatest stage was a given, but neither will feature in this season's Champions League. Ronaldo was one of the first big names to move to Saudi Arabia - he plays for Al Nassr - while Messi is in the United States with Inter Miami. They are not the only two absentees, Brazil forward Neymar and France striker Karim Benzema having joined Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League. They are with Al Hilal and Al-Ittihad respectively. We will still get to see some of the biggest names of the present and future, with France striker Kylian Mbappe at PSG and City goal machine Erling Haaland looking to break more records. Lamine Yamal is also causing plenty of excitement. The 16-year-old this year became Barcelona's youngest player of all time as well as the youngest debutant and scorer for Spain. 19-20 September. 3-4 October. 24-25 October. 7-8 November. 28-29 November. 12-13 December.  13-14, 20-21 February 2024 and 5-6, 12-13 March. 9-10, 16-17 April.  30 April, 1 May, 7-8 May.  1 June. The final this season will be held at Wembley. City are favourites to win the Champions League, ahead of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, according to simulations based on Gracenote's Euro Club Index. City have a 37% chance of victory, Real 13% and Bayern 11%, and there is a 19% chance that a new name will be on the trophy. City, Real, Bayern and Barcelona each have at least a 90% chance of reaching the knockout stage. This will be the last season of the existing format - 32 teams in the group phase, split up into eight groups of four, and the top two going to the last 16 - with widespread changes coming in for 2024-25.

{"title": "Feyenoord vs Celtic: Can Brendan Rodgers deliver Champions League progress for Scots?", "content": "\"I'm here again to win and to look to see if we can do something in Europe.\" That was the ambition Brendan Rodgers outlined on his return to Celtic as manager this summer. And it is what Celtic supporters will crave. It's been a long time since the club did something significant on the European scene. That statement of intent from Rodgers has lingered during the start of the domestic campaign, but his arrival wasn't the time to explore it in great detail.  With the club's Champions League campaign set to get going here in Rotterdam on Tuesday night against Feyenoord, now seems appropriate to delve in further. So, what would amount to \"something\" exactly? Last week, Rodgers elaborated by stating: \"Our overall aim is to be in Europe after Christmas.\" After the 3-0 win over Dundee, as Celtic prepare to face Feyenoord away in their opening Champions League group stage encounter, he added: \"I know there always can be a wee bit of trepidation going into the Champions League and the level, but for me there is nothing but excitement.\" When the Champions League anthem bellows from the PA system in De Kuip on Tuesday evening, the excitement will most certainly spill over. It tends to make hairs stand up on the back of the neck no matter the occasion. More so, ahead of the opening group match when everyone is on equal footing. With that post-Christmas aim in mind, third place or better is then required. Just how much trepidation there might be amidst all that excitement is worthy of examination as Rodgers pursues that target. By his own admission, Celtic \"can definitely do better\". A look at their Champions League record absolutely rams that home, not just under Rodgers. It's a long time since the heady days of 'Fortress Parkhead', when the likes of Juventus, AC Milan and Manchester United all departed with nothing. That home element was a massive factor in previous success, something the manager will look to tap into. Of late, the only group win came away at Anderlecht under Rodgers in 2017, a result that on its own, alongside five defeats, secured third place in their group. That win ended a punishing run of 16 group games without victory. There have been none since in the 10 games they've played, drawing twice. It doesn't make good reading. Yet this season's draw perhaps offers some optimism. Tough, but not an insurmountable task. Of the Pot A seeded teams, Feyenoord were lowest ranked. They will be a formidable test, but one Celtic can approach with a degree of hope, if they perform and find the right balance. That's with further tests against Atletico Madrid and Lazio lying ahead. Last season, Celtic earned plaudits for their overall approach in the group stage. They tried to play their attack-minded 'Ange-ball' game no matter the opposition under now-Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.  It didn't translate into wins, just two draws against Shakhtar Donetsk, but seemed to provide a platform to build upon this season. Compared to Rangers' bruising experience on the same stage, Celtic came off lightly. Now, after Rodgers' return, Celtic's European performances under him have come under the microscope to give indicators of likely success. Will this time be any different? In his first tenure, a high-pressing, attacking approach was the usual hallmark, no matter the competition. At Champions League level, 7-0, 7-1 and 5-0 reverses followed. There were some utterly bruising evenings over two Champions League campaigns that delivered that solitary, yet impressive, win over Anderlecht from 12 games. The quality of opposition has to be acknowledged, given it included a Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar-inspired Barcelona, a Kylian Mbappe, Neymar (again) and Edinson Cavani-inspired Paris St-Germain, and a Robert Lewandowski, Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller-inspired Bayern Munich. Amid all the anguish were creditable draws against a highly impressive Manchester City - twice - and a point away to Borussia Monchengladbach. Not easy feats and those are points to consider in anticipation of this challenge. As is the fact Rodgers's team came through challenging qualifying rounds in those two years, effectively in pre-season. Overall, though, it felt that Celtic were trying to keep their head above water with little prospect of progression. A Europa League campaign, after failing to reach the Champions League groups, brought some progress before, in early 2019, Celtic lost out to Valencia in the last 32 and within weeks, Rodgers was back in the English Premier League with Leicester City. This time, with the benefit of not having to navigate the qualifying process, there's anticipation as to whether Celtic can arrest these trends and develop beyond domestic dominance. Rodgers' record with the Foxes, and his approach, suggests this time may be different. At least tactically. Slightly less pressing high up perhaps with a level of pragmatism when the occasion merits it. In Europe, there was a clear improvement in Rodgers' European record at Europa League and Europa Conference League level. That may offer the Celtic support some hope. If they can overcome significant injury issues, particularly in defence, then a win or two may be achievable. Or more. In May 2022, the former Liverpool manager guided Leicester City to a Europa Conference League semi-final, losing by a one-goal margin over two legs to eventual winners Roma. Not quite the Champions League you might argue. Yet, Jose Mourinho's Roma side went on to beat, guess who, Feyenoord. Rodgers has previously alluded to evolving as a manager and tailoring his approach when required, conceding that it's not in his DNA but required at times. \"Ultimately, the game's about winning. I won't be averse to having that balance this time between attacking and having that little bit of pragmatism,\" he has said. Given Celtic's recent European record, you suspect that pragmatism will come into play more often than not, especially on their travels.

{"title": "AC Milan: Can the Rossoneri bounce back from Inter thrashing in Champions League?", "content": "Losing 5-1 to Inter in the Derby della Madonnina on Saturday night, Stefano Pioli, AC Milan's Coach, was asked if he should apologise to the fans.  Inter had just achieved a historic feat by defeating their city rivals for the fifth time in a row this year, scoring 12 and conceding only one goal along the way.  By  winning this derby  Inter have proved yet again why they are the favourites to win Serie A and while the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Marcelo Brozovic have departed, they continue to find ways to exercise their excellence. However, Pioli's curious tactical decisions and the way in which his team folded in the last quarter of the game has invited plenty of criticism and melodramatic reactions. Up until suffering their heaviest derby defeat for a few decades this weekend, Milan were performing beyond expectations at this early stage of the season to shut down any concerns with regards to their summer revolution. Allowing Paolo Maldini, club legend and beloved director, to leave only to then sell die-hard Milanista Sandro Tonali had several wondering if new owners Red Bird understood the culture of the club. Ten new signings later and Milan were delighting spectators with overwhelming attacking patterns of play that left us wondering how Pioli was able to embed so many new signings so quickly. Christian Pulisic and Olivier Giroud, two former Chelsea players, immediately displayed their familiarity with one another, creating and scoring goals together. The dynamism of Tijjani Reijnders, who frequently made intelligent runs into the box, coupled with Ruben Loftus-Cheek's vision, energy and willingness to cover ground has us believing in this new Milan.  The side were no longer left leaning, hoping Rafael Leao would conjure up magic on the left or that someone would deliver a great ball for Giroud. Now there were options all across the pitch and on the bench.  Yet defensively, there were still some questions. Milan may have won their first three games of the season, scoring eight, but the two goals they did concede raised concerns. Fikayo Tomori was sent off against Roma and while the Rossoneri still won that match, the defender was going to miss the derby. A huge loss.  Even in his presence, the vulnerable-looking defence bred concerns as to how Milan would cope against better attacking sides. We had seen the backline exposed far too frequently last season and were yet to understand if they had resolved this issue. Most of the incoming transfers were made to bolster the attack, not solidify a defence that conceded 43 goals to Napoli's 28 last term.  Would this midfield offer enough of a filter? Tomori's performances in his first season drew widespread praise because he drew so much confidence from the running done by the likes of Franck Kessie and Tonali ahead of him. Last year, his performances were less complimented when the midfield grew more overwhelmed and overworked.  However, Tomori is Milan's best centre-back and without him not only did Malick Thiaw fall apart but the Rossoneri defence crumbled. Inter's physicality, rehearsed understanding of how to double up and their midfield density served to nullify any opposing attacking threats while allowing themselves to endlessly threaten in the transitions.  Prior to the derby, Milan were confident of their attacking prowess across the pitch due to the abundant number of attackers capable of one-on-ones. However, Inter proved pre-season fears correct when they starved Milan of that space and forced them to operate in tight spaces against physically imposing players.  Milan lost 5-1 and deserve to be subjected to criticisms but not exaggerated questioning. This is a side with 10 new players that have yet to understand their limitations and true strengths. This is only the fourth match of the season and nothing great can be achieved so quickly. Inter boast more experience and the continuity of a project that yielded an impressive performance in the Champions League final. They too have changed but not to the same degree and are rightfully favourites for the Serie A title and always bound to be the hardest opposition to face for this new Milan.  Pioli is adamant his side are resilient enough to weather this psychological storm. 2023 has proved to be a tough year for the Rossoneri in these derby fixtures, but it is worth remembering Pioli won two Serie A derbies in a row in 2022 and was the first coach to manage it since Massimiliano Allegri in 2011, so he shouldn't be doubted… yet. Milan will welcome Newcastle in the Champions League on Tuesday and the Italian side will be eager to repent. The Rossoneri are still deliciously effusive going forward and will have Tomori back in defence to hopefully ensure a more balanced performance. The club is quietly confident of their chances to escape what is currently being labelled as the group of death. Champions League success in a priority for this side for financial reasons as well as for their reputation. Only Real Madrid have won more trophies than Milan in this competition and they hope they will be allowed to progress to the knockouts to demonstrate their expected maturity.  Anything is possible but perhaps somewhat improbable. With such heavy fixture lists and players subjected to playing so many more minutes, squad depth and the quality of that depth will make the difference. That unfortunately requires money but the reason we love this sport is because of its unpredictability. However, nearly every year we witness at least one excellent story in the Champions League and while the less rich may not win the entire competition, they can still compete till the end. Inter made £261m in revenue in the season prior to last according to the Deloitte Football Money League, ranking 14th in terms of revenue in Europe. Milan were ranked 16th and yet they contested the semi-final.  Inter were excellent in the final and according to Pep Guardiola, were unlucky to not have won.  Juventus contested the Champions League final in 2015 despite a small budget. In fact, even the likes of Schalke were making more in commercial revenue than the Italian giants. Interestingly, the more they earned in revenue, the harder they found it to compete in the latter stages of the competition. Money is an advantage but the lack of it allows for innovation and well-run teams will always compete.  His importance to the club cannot be adequately quantified. When Jose Mourinho was announced as Roma's new coach, AS Roma shares rocketed by more than 21% while the club's brand continues to grow largely due to the pull of his name and reputation. It is often noted in Italy that he is a large reason why players like Paulo Dybala and now Romelu Lukaku have chosen to play in Roma.  Winning the club's first European trophy since 1961, the 2022 Europa Conference League, has elevated his status even more, not to mention reaching the Europa League final one year later. He has added value to the club and the fans often sing his name. Sold out stadiums (which equates to revenue) is what we have come to expect from Roma and regardless of his antics, he is very well loved and respected by the fans and the club. Away from Rome, he has his critics and questions have been asked of his team's style of play.  He seems committed to the club for this last year, his contract ends in June 2024 and it's worth mentioning he turned down more lucrative deals from Saudi Arabia to stay on this Roma path and for that they are thankful.  In Serie A, several and hopefully the league will get to keep them!   is one to look out for and is the current Fiorentina right-back. He started Fiorentina's first game of the season against Genoa and dazzled on the pitch but was then reportedly struck down with Tonsilitis so hasn't featured since.  He was also the player who scored the only goal of the game to ensure Italy's success in UEFA's European Under-19 Championship. Intelligent runs coupled with tidy passing and a strong mentality, Coach Vincenzo Italiano will be looking to play the right-back quite often in this busy season. He is a player who fears nothing while his athleticism is exactly what the club need going forward. is an Italian centre-back who plays for Atalanta and the Italian national team. Only 19 years old, he's incredibly elegant, highly technical but will never turn down the chance to engage in a physical battle. He's tall and strong and will ensure his opponents are aware of it but he's also someone who can pick out a clever pass and allow the team to keep progressing up the pitch.  Luciano Spalletti is already depending on him as he tries to ensure Italy qualify for the upcoming Euros.  is a Juventus winger who is highly admired. The Englishman recently had his contract extended and he's someone who seems to always know how to make an impact on the pitch. In Juventus' Champions League match against Benfica last season, the Italians were losing 4-1. After Iling-Junior came on, he not only assisted Arkadiusz Milik's goal to make it 4-2 but delivered a key ball into the box to help Juve make it 4-3. Tactically smart, dynamic and capable of getting past his opponents with ease to deliver delectable passes, his introduction is what helped Juve to recover a point against Bologna when they were down 1-0 two weeks ago, delivering the assist for Dusan Vlahovic's finish.

{"title": "Union Berlin: From second tier to Real Madrid away with 'terror football from Kopenick'", "content": "\"Wahnsinn - it means crazy, mad, incredible. All those things in one word.\" That single German word is how Union Berlin fan Jon Darch describes the past five seasons for his club - and one of the most remarkable rises in European football. Five years ago Union were playing in the second tier of German football. On Wednesday they will make their Champions League debut against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. In consecutive seasons they have gone from 2 Bundesliga to Bundesliga, then into Europe with the Uefa Europa Conference League, then the Europa League and now the Champions League. They are the first side from Berlin to play in Europe's elite competition since the traditionally larger Hertha did so in 1999-2000. This season Hertha are in the second tier, looking up at their noisy neighbours. It is a journey made not with state backing, billionaire owners or - for the most part - household names in the playing squad. The club are entirely fan owned, financed by more than 40,000 supporter memberships, with those members making key decisions such as the appointment of the chief executive and board. \"Union have shown a third way,\" says Mark Wilson, who runs Union In Englisch, a blog and podcast for English-speaking fans. \"Compared to manufactured clubs like Leipzig and factory teams like Wolfsburg, Union have shown a traditional way to success, which is not just about spending money. We are not a cult club - just a club which has entrenched itself in its community.\" A large portion of Union's success is put down to the combination of Swiss manager Urs Fischer and managing director Oliver Ruhnert, both of whom have been in place since 2018 and have overseen the club's rise. Bas Timmers, author of the book 'Abnormally Ordinary - A Dutchman explains Union Berlin', says that, amid the club's reputation for passionate supporters and socialist outlook, their intelligent business is often overlooked. \"Appointing Fischer and Ruhnert was a major turnaround,\" he says. \"They have made all the difference. \"The squad planning has been meticulous. Ruhnert found a lot of players which Fischer saw the possibility to develop.\" \"Ruhnert goes out every summer, buys seven players we have never heard of, and Fischer forms them into a team,\" adds Darch, a safe-standing campaigner who has been a fan of Union since moving to Berlin 22 years ago. \"Fischer is a miracle worker. And he fits Union so well - he is so down to earth. His native tongue is not high German, but a very Swiss version of German. He has to speak slowly so people can understand him - that helps him come across as very measured.\" On the pitch Timmers describes Union's counter-attacking style as \"terror football from Kopenick\", the district of Berlin in which Union is based. \"Pragmatic, realistic and well executed,\" he says. \"There are not a lot of clubs in Germany which have been run well in the last 10 years. Bayern and Leipzig maybe, with an attacking playing philosophy to admire. Union has developed their own brand of that - hard to beat football, with maximum effect.\" The rise into the Champions League has not been universally welcomed by fans, particularly given the choice of venue. Union play their league games at Stadion An der Alten Forsterei, a 22,000-capacity stadium with only 3,000 seats which is renowned for its ferocious atmosphere, and which did not have a roof until 2008 when it was built primarily by volunteer fans. Despite Uefa rules permitting Union to play at home, the club's board wanted more fans to be able to attend. So their debut Champions League campaign will take place at the 75,000-capacity Olympiastadion - home of Hertha. \"Commercially the club will do very well,\" says Wilson. \"You can have 40,000 season-ticket holders at the stadium. Then there will be fascinated neutrals, maybe people who couldn't get to a game before.\" Union have aimed to stick to the club ethos with pricing - mini season tickets for the three home group stage games are available for 75 euros - and by allocating 1,000 free tickets per Champions League game for needy fans. But Timmers is still unconvinced. \"When we got to the Bundesliga, there were fears the club might change, but no competition or player is bigger than the club. \"I am worried about the Champions League. It has changed our club. It is a big-money league with teams who in our opinion do not belong there - Manchester City, Newcastle, PSG, the marketing club from Leipzig. \"That is not our league, that's why I have mixed feelings. The Olympic stadium is not home.\" Another change to the Union of years gone by can be seen in their summer transfer strategy as they prepare for Champions League football. Gone are the days of identifying hidden gems who can be turned to profit - such as Taiwo Awoniyi,  sold to Nottingham Forest  for £20m in 2022. Arrivals have included Germany wing-back Robin Gosens for a club record fee, as well as midfielder Brenden Aaronson and striker David Datro Fofana, recruited on loan from Leeds and Chelsea respectively. None is more eye-catching, however, than Leonardo Bonucci. The 36-year-old multiple Serie A champion and Euro 2020-winning defender made Union his first club outside Italy when joining from Juventus this summer. \"Surreal,\" says Timmers of Bonucci's arrival. \"A European champion, a world champion, doesn't necessarily belong here. But he could have gone to Saudi Arabia, and instead goes for something more ambitious - and he brings Champions League experience. \"We have done this before, signing (ex-Borussia Dortmund defender) Neven Subotic when we were promoted. One-year contract, low risk. It is a realistic, pragmatic approach - then we can see where we are in 10 months.\" So is there a risk that Union could lose their precious identity as they garner further success? \"It was always the worry of the fans,\" says Wilson, referencing one chant from the year Union were promoted. \"It will sound strange in England - would Brentford or Bournemouth be worried about playing in the Premier League? Union fans were genuinely worried. But the matchday experience has not been diluted. \"Everyone thinks their club is special - it's that in-built community everyone has. At Union, you get this real sense of community. You know the members, the people involved, it gets to you.\" Union have been drawn into what looks like one of this season's toughest  Champions League groups  alongside Real, Napoli and Braga. Expectations of what would be a successful European campaign are measured. Wilson would be happy with third place in Group C and dropping into the Europa League. Timmers has different ambitions. \"I'm counting on two to four points for the campaign,\" he says. \"I expect on the pitch we will not be outplayed at home, but might get some lessons in efficiency - teams like Madrid do not need to have a good day to score out of nowhere. \"Off the pitch, I expect a huge away adventure. I just hope we can maintain the Union culture of togetherness - eating a bratwurst, drinking a beer, supporting our team.\" Darch delves into his German dictionary for another word to sum up Union's situation. \"Klassenerhalt - class retention. Forget the Champions League - just get 40 points. Staying up is all that counts. Everything else is a bonus.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66769248"},
{"title": "Pep Guardiola: Manchester City boss says club 'in trouble' with mounting injury list", "content": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says his side are \"in trouble\" with a mounting injury list that threatens to disrupt the club's perfect start to the season. City only had six outfield players on their bench for the  3-1 Champions League victory  over Red Star Belgrade. And their seventh successive triumph in all competitions came at a cost as midfielder Bernardo Silva became the latest player to pick up an injury which, according to Guardiola, will keep him out for \"the next few weeks\". The Portuguese international joins Kevin de Bruyne, Jack Grealish, Mateo Kovacic and John Stones on the sidelines. This comes after a summer in which City sold Riyad Mahrez, Cole Palmer and Aymeric Laporte, skipper Ilkay Gundogan joined Barcelona at the end of his contract and Joao Cancelo, plus youngsters Tommy Doyle and James McAtee, left on loan. Given the riches he has lavished on his squad, few neutrals will have sympathy for Guardiola. However, coming in a period where City have three more Premier League games, including a trip to Arsenal on 8 October, a Carabao Cup tie at Newcastle and another Champions League outing, at RB Leipzig, before the next international break, Guardiola says \"we are in trouble\". \"We are in trouble but I am not going to say 'oh, we have a lot of injuries'. It is what it is,\" said Guardiola \"With the players we have, we will go for it. As long as we have that mentality, that is good \"We have five really important players injured and to sustain that for a long time would be difficult.\" City spent more than £200m on new players in the summer, including Matheus Nunes, who made his first start  since arriving from Wolves for £53m  on deadline day. \"We can't have, with the salaries and the budgets for the transfers, 55 players,\" added Guardiola. \"It would be chaos for the clubs.

Bellingham's strike was his sixth goal in six matches for Madrid since joining Los Blancos this summer.  Federico Valverde's 94th-minute shot deflected into the path of the England midfield who tapped into an empty net. Union, in their first Champions League match, were unable to respond with just one minute remaining. Carlo Ancelotti chose to play Jude Bellingham in a more advanced number 10 role, and the former Borussia Dortmund and Birmingham City star once again excelled. He was integral to the Spanish La Liga side's creativity in attack as they racked up 22 shots to their opponent's three. And, for the third time already in his Real career, the 20-year-old netted a winner for Los Blancos inside the final 10 minutes. Indeed, without Bellingham's goals Real Madrid would be nine points worse off just six matches into the season. Real Madrid were deserved winners, having twice hit the post in the second half, although Union looked set for a fairytale draw at the home of the record 14-time winners. The hosts, semi-finalists in last season's competition, started brightly as Joselu headed Bellingham's teasing cross over the bar. But Ancelotti's side failed to kick on in the first period, although they themselves were rarely threatened by the visitors. In the second half, Real were a team transformed as Lucas Vazquez crossed for Rodrygo who struck the outside of the post in the 51st minute with an acrobatic effort. Nine minutes later, Union keeper Frederik Ronnow tipped Joselu's header on to the woodwork. Ronnow also made a series of fine saves to keep out Rodrygo and Luka Modric, while Joselu poked a late volley narrowly wide.

{"title": "Arsenal v PSV Eindhoven: Gunners mark Champions League return with ruthless win", "content": "520 Arsenal returned to the Champions League in style as they started their first campaign in six years with an impressive win over PSV Eindhoven at Emirates Stadium.  The Gunners wrapped up victory in their opening Group B game with a scintillating first half display that saw them race into a 3-0 lead on a rain-soaked night in north London.  Bukayo Saka opened the scoring after eight minutes, pouncing on a rebound when PSV keeper Walter Benitez could only push Martin Odegaard's into the England winger's path.  Saka was involved again when Arsenal doubled their advantage 12 minutes later, laying the ball perfectly into Leandro Trossard's pass for a smooth low finish after Gabriel Jesus had broken clear.  Jesus was outstanding and thoroughly deserved to add Arsenal's third seven minutes before half-time with a rising drive that gave Benitez no chance.  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta made a host of second-half changes with Sunday's derby at home to in-form Tottenham in mind, but his side still retained complete control, and Odegaard made it 4-0 with a powerful 20-yard strike with 20 minutes left. Elsewhere in Group B, French side Lens held Sevilla to a 1-1 draw in Spain as they played in their first Champions League match in 20 years. Arsenal had been waiting for this day since 2017, and the home crowd celebrated their return to the Champions League with a thunderous roar before kick-off as the tournament's anthem rang around Emirates Stadium.  And manager Arteta could hardly have wished for a better outcome as Arsenal dominated from the outset, those two early goals emphasising their superiority over PSV and a giving them a control they never looked like relinquishing.  Striker Jesus was a perfect leader of the line, scoring one, helping to create another with a surging break, and also forcing a superb diving save out of keeper Benitez after some outstanding footwork.  David Raya was again chosen ahead of Aaron Ramsdale in goal, and while he was hardly examined, he showed again why Arteta rates him so highly by demonstrating safe handling in conditions difficult as well as some excellent distribution with the ball at his feet.  The added bonus for Arteta was that Arsenal's victory was so comfortable that he was able to make changes early to keep players fresh for that fixture against Spurs on Sunday.  Saka, Jesus, Trossard, Declan Rice, and Oleksandr Zinchenko were all given an early night to conserve energies for what is shaping up as one of the biggest games of the Premier League season.  The Gunners' spirits could not be higher after following up their vital win at Everton last weekend with a display full of enough of their trademark fluency to outclass their Dutch opponents.

{"title": "Bayern Munich 4-3 Man Utd: Harry Kane on target as Red Devils poor form continues", "content": "1982 Manchester United were given a taste of what could have been as Harry Kane helped Bayern Munich to victory over Erik ten Hag's struggling side in a high-scoring and eventful Champions League opener. It was no secret that the Red Devils would have liked to have signed Kane from Tottenham in the summer, but instead England's captain and record goalscorer opted for a career in Germany that has begun in stellar fashion. At the Allianz Arena on Wednesday, the 30-year-old claimed both an assist and scored from the penalty spot - after a VAR check to rule Christian Eriksen had handled in the box - to take his tally of goals this season to five in five games in all competitions. It was a timely strike from Kane too as it came just after Rasmus Hojland had scored his first United goal to make it 2-1 early in the second half and give his side some hope of a result. Before that, goalkeeper Andre Onana had undone a disciplined start from the visitors with a shocking error to allow Leroy Sane's drive to slip under him and find the net in the 28th minute. Four minutes later, Serge Gnabry struck low and accurately inside the far corner to make it 2-0. It is to the visitors' credit that they came out swinging to try and make a contest of it but their current fragility and lack of options from the bench as a result of numerous injuries undermined their ability to compete. Casemiro showed dogged determination to smuggle a second in for United to give them a glimmer of hope but Mathys Tel snuffed that out by hammering a Bayern fourth high into the net in added time. United were not finished, with Casemiro heading home Bruno Fernandes' free-kick from close range with almost the last kick of the game, but it was too late. An opening-game loss at the six-time champions of Europe will not define the campaign, especially with FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray - who drew 2-2 earlier on Wednesday in Istanbul - both more beatable in the group, but they are now in dire need of a response to restore some focus and faith.  After a 2022-23 campaign of progress, United are again sailing in choppy waters. Last season, Ten Hag looked to have steadied one of European football's biggest ships following the failure of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer tenure and the ill-advised interim experiment with Ralf Rangnick. Having led them to a first piece of major silverware in six seasons and back into the Champions League, optimism was high at the club ahead of this campaign. But three defeats from the first five league games - their worst league start in a decade - has seen this rapidly evaporate and now they must digest a humbling start to their European campaign. It could have been different. They could, and probably should, have led inside five minutes as Alphonso Davies' timely tackle stopped Facundo Pellistri tapping in but set up Christian Eriksen to fire an effort from close range straight at Sven Ulreich. Similarly, at the start of the second half, had they been able to test Bayern's resolve for longer at 2-1 rather than conceding again inside five minutes they may have taken something. And then at the end they showed fight to forge Casemiro's double only for that to be made moot by their soft concession of a fourth. This is a United side undone by early-season results, injuries and costly moments of ineptitude.  Onana's error was a shocker and one a side with such fragile confidence can ill afford. It was followed by a period where players seemed happier to hide than rally in the face of adversity. Before Wednesday's game, Ten Hag bemoaned that he had yet to field his strongest XI during his tenure and maybe it is only fair to judge him and his side this season when they are closer to that? But this is still a United side with talent in it and one that needs to not only win at Burnley on Saturday but do so convincingly. Bayern were not at their best. They have not been so for much of this season. They were also without suspended manager Thomas Tuchel as assistant Zsolt Low took charge on the touchline. But they are a winning machine and with Kane in attack, supplemented by Sane, Gnabry and Musiala, they will be a test for any defence on the continent, let alone one as currently shaky as United's. It was not Kane's best game, with him floating in and out of it, but he did what was required. His neat set-up enabled the opener and he made no mistake with a typically ruthless penalty. They should have scored more, hitting the post twice after the break, and allowed United footholds in the game, but their ability to move rapidly up through the gears remains highly impressive. That is 35 games unbeaten now for the German champions in the group stage of this competition and 15 straight home wins. It gives them early control of Group A.

{"title": "Arsenal 4-0 PSV Eindhoven: Gunners mark Champions League return with perfect performance", "content": "Arsenal were desperate to make up for six years of lost time in the Champions League and made PSV Eindhoven pay heavily for the pain of those days in the wilderness on a rain-soaked night at Emirates Stadium. The script for  Arsenal's 4-0 win  could have been penned by manager Mikel Arteta, so perfect was every aspect of this performance, played out in biblical conditions in north London. Yes, the weather was far from ideal but Arsenal's display was close to it as they outclassed a PSV side who had been unbeaten in 26 games, only to be totally over-powered here. It is far too early to debate just how deep Arsenal can go into the Champions League after one game, but no-one can doubt this was a hugely impressive return. The only question left for Arteta to answer is one every manager relishes. Which of his two high-class goalkeepers will start in the crucial north London derby against Tottenham here on Sunday? David Raya, who got the nod against PSV, or Aaron Ramsdale? Arteta's obvious pleasure at the final whistle was brought on by a performance which was full of the old fluidity of last season, exemplified by a scintillating first half that served as a statement of intent about Arsenal's ambitions in Europe's elite competition this season. PSV were swept aside in those early phases, with fit-again Gabriel Jesus showing the quality he offers as well as the attacking focal point he provides when he is available to Arteta. Bukayo Saka had already put Arsenal ahead when Jesus played him in after a lightning spin away from PSV's defence. He passed to Leandro Trossard, who showed the class he demonstrated when scoring the winner at Everton on Sunday by steering in a smooth finish. Jesus deservedly drove home a third before half-time, and Martin Odegaard's fourth was a fine flourish on a game that was already won. So complete was Arsenal's control that Arteta was able to start preparations for the north London derby in advance by giving Saka, Trossard, Jesus, Declan Rice and Oleksandr Zinchenko an early night. It simply could not have gone much better for Arsenal, Arteta or the Gunners fans, who made their way home in high spirits despite being drenched by the torrential downpour. And so to the \"good headache\" - as Arteta described it - of selection decisions awaiting him ahead of that meeting with in-form Spurs, who arrive at Emirates Stadium rejuvenated by the Ange Postecoglou effect. The big choice, of course, is between Raya and Ramsdale. It will also be the clearest indicator yet of who Arteta now regards as his number one goalkeeper. The logical thinking is that if Arteta decided Raya was the keeper for Everton on Sunday and here against PSV, then surely he must face Spurs, no matter how disappointed or harshly treated England's Ramsdale will feel. Raya was hardly tested here but his handling was perfect in testing conditions while his distribution with the ball at his feet was outstanding. The Spaniard showed a full range of passing, both long and short, delivered with impressive accuracy. The goalkeeping position will be a hot topic of debate until it becomes evident who Arteta favours and whoever is in goal on Sunday must be considered his preferred candidate. For all the talk of rotation, it must be detrimental to have uncertainty about one of the most pivotal positions in the team. Raya has kept two clean sheets, shown impressive handling and confirmed the good impression he created at Brentford. What reason would there be for Arteta to revert back to Ramsdale? This is no slight on Ramsdale, but it is clear Arteta has seen something that made him move for Raya, even though the former played an outstanding part in Arsenal's Premier League challenge last season. Arteta is in the fortunate position of having two fine keepers to choose between but alternation is ultimately unrealistic. One of Raya or Ramsdale must be anointed as number one and quickly. For now, however, Arteta and Arsenal can bask in a job supremely well done in front of supporters so keen to celebrate the club's return to the Champions League that the sound of the tournament's anthem sent a huge roar sweeping around Emirates Stadium before kick-off. Absence from the Champions League had made Arsenal's heart grow fonder and this victory was well worth that six-year wait.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66870515"},

In an eventful game in Germany, Onana's error gifted Bayern a crucial lead that they quickly doubled after United had started in disciplined fashion. A flurry of goals followed but United were always chasing and ultimately fell short,  suffering a 4-3 loss . \"This is the life of a goalkeeper,\" Onana told TNT Sports. \"It's difficult. We started very good. After my mistake we lost control of the game. It's a difficult situation for us, for me especially because I'm the one who let the team down. \"We were very good on the ball, they didn't create any chances, their first shot on target I made a mistake. It was the key point and the team went down because of that mistake. \"If we didn't win today it was because of me. \"I have to learn from it and be strong. I have a lot to prove. My start in Manchester hasn't been so good, not how I want. This was one of my worst games.\" Speaking in his role as a pundit on TNT, former United defender Rio Ferdinand agreed with Onana's assessment that the mistake was crucial to the game. \"All the blame [for that goal] lays at his door,\" he said. \"It was a straightforward save. It's not a hard shot to deal with. He'd expect to make that save.  \"It epitomises Manchester United this season. Most of the goals they've conceded this season, they could have made tougher for the opposition. He hasn't dealt with a big moment there.\" Onana joined United in the summer for £47.2m after helping Inter Milan reach the final of last season's Champions League. However, the Cameroon international has struggled at times behind a shaky defence, conceding 14 goals in six games in all competitions. They have now lost four of those six games this season and each of the past three. While his error was indeed costly, Onana did also make five saves in Wednesday's game to prevent Bayern running away with the match. Manager Erik ten Hag refused to let his goalkeeper take sole responsibility for the loss, saying there is a group accountability for results. \"It's good he's doing that but it's about the team,\" said Ten Hag when told of Onana's comments. \"Mistakes are being made but you have to bounce back as a team.  \"If one player makes a mistake, it's done, its gone. We have to believe as a team that we can always bounce back. Tonight we showed it. \"Stay in the game and don't allow the opponent to score a goal. It's not about one mistake. It was too easy for the player to have the shot.\" There were some positives for Ten Hag to take from the game, notably the way they fought back in to the contest twice to give themselves hope. But United were undone by their fragility. \"[We are] disappointed because we should stay in the game,\" continued the Dutchman. \"If you score three goals at Bayern Munich you have to take a point. \"We are in a period, a lot is going against us. We have to make our own luck. We've played great teams in the last three games.\" They next travel to Burnley for a Premier League game on Saturday evening. \"Every game is important, every game is huge,\" added Ten Hag. \"We have to make our own luck.

{"title": "Newcastle United 4-1 Paris St-Germain: Eddie Howe's roar to victory over French champions", "content": "1557 Newcastle United welcomed Champions League football back to St James' Park in style as Paris St-Germain were overpowered in a highly charged atmosphere on Tyneside. The French champions - including superstar Kylian Mbappe - found the atmosphere and intensity on and off the pitch just too much as Eddie Howe's side secured a richly deserved win in Newcastle's first home game in Europe's elite competition since a 2-0 defeat by Barcelona in March 2003. The Toon Army had already transformed St James' Park into four walls of black and white even before Miguel Almiron sent them wild by giving them a 17th-minute lead after PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could only palm out Alexander Isak's shot, as Marquinhos was punished for carelessly conceding possession. It was to prove an eventful night for Italy keeper Donnarumma, who tried in vain to claw out Dan Burn's towering header six minutes before half-time. The ball had already crossed the line but Newcastle still had to wait for a video assistant referee check for offside before the celebrations could begin. Donnarumma was a central figure again as Newcastle went three up five minutes after the break, the goalkeeper's poor attempt at a block allowing Sean Longstaff's powerful shot from an angle to creep in. PSG's threats were rare but they did pull one back after 56 minutes through Lucas Hernandez's header - but this was Newcastle's night from start to finish. Swiss centre-back Fabian Schar added the icing on the cake in stoppage time as he curled a stunning shot past Donnarumma from the edge of the box into the top corner to make it 4-1. The three points, added to an opening draw away to AC Milan, mean Newcastle go top of Group F. \"We are really pleased. It was a brilliant effort from the players,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told CBS. \"It was a different game. It was a cat and mouse between the two, we were trying to press them and they were trying to play through us. \"We were successful a couple of times which led to big goals for us, so I am delighted with the players commitment.\" Newcastle was alive with Champions League anticipation hours before kick-off as supporters flooded around St. James Park for the first game here in this competition for two decades. When the draw was made, the meeting with Mbappe and PSG was ringed on the calendar as proof that Newcastle had returned to the big time. And how the Toon Army relished this as their side delivered the performance and occasion they had craved to put themselves in a good position with four points from their opening two group games. Tough tests lie ahead but on the evidence of the wall of noise and colour - well black and white - that unnerved PSG here, Newcastle will have no fears about any opposition who come to Tyneside. \"We made it as clear as we could. We wanted to be ourselves when we played AC Milan and we were not where we needed to be,\" Howe added. \"But I think that was expected with the three defeats previously to that game. I think we came here with a lot more confident mood. We wanted to be ourselves and then take the result whatever it is.\" Newcastle tore into PSG from the first whistle, backed by a frenzied support, and once Almiron set them on their way after 17 minutes there was no looking back. And how fitting it was that two local boys, Burn and Longstaff, were also on target on a night that will live long in the memory for every supporter who witnessed it. And Schar's scorching finish was a perfect way to round off this glory night. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 0-0 with AC Milan elsewhere on Wednesday, are the next visitors to Tyneside on 25 October - after this Newcastle and their supporters can hardly wait. Mbappe was the man Newcastle's fans feared, his early touches greeted with a cacophony of jeering, which he met by almost creating an early goal for Ousmane Dembele, who volleyed a great chance wide. That was just about it for the world-class forward, who cut a frustrated and marginalised figure for the rest of the night, often outnumbered by Newcastle defenders and not on the same wavelength of his PSG team-mates on a desperately poor night for Luis Enrique's side. Mbappe is obviously the centrepiece of PSG's plans but for how long with Real Madrid long rumoured to be his next destination? This is a side of parts that in no way resembles a team of quality, and they were brutally exposed by Newcastle.

This was a night that Newcastle supporters had been waiting for, along with Newcastle-born goalscorers Longstaff and Dan Burn. \"It's some night,\" Longstaff, who is a product of the club's academy system, told TNT Sports. \"I think we knew it was going to be special with the atmosphere but for me and Burny to score on a night like tonight is pretty surreal. \"I am lost for words really. \"I think, to be honest, there are some of us that thought three years ago we were probably out of the door and it wasn't a great place to be.  \"I am so proud to be from Newcastle and I am over the moon.\" Before Wednesday's match, Newcastle's last Champions League game at St James' Park was in 2003. Longstaff was only five years old. He grew up watching Bobby Robson's side, which featured the likes of Alan Shearer and Shay Given - both of whom watched on at the stadium as he smashed the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma to make it 3-0 early in the second half. The other Geordie on the scoresheet was Burn, whose towering first-half header brought his story full circle, having been released by Newcastle at 11 years of age. \"It has not sunk in,\" the 31-year-old told TNT Sports. \"I am a bit speechless. \"I was released by Fulham at 25 years old. To come back and play Champions League football, I am very proud.\" \"It is like dream I am waiting for someone to wake me up, I am waiting for the bubble to pop.\" For two local lads to get on the scoresheet against one of Europe's top sides was a special moment for the fans inside St James' Park, and Newcastle manager Eddie Howe was quick to praise the supporters for the imposing atmosphere they created. \"In every team talk I mention the crowd because they are so powerful,\" he told CBS Sports. \"If we don't use the crowd and [instead] play a style of football where they are not going to be involved in the game we are missing a trick. \"We try and use their energy to help the players implement what we want. \"I am delighted for the club and the supporters what they gave us tonight was incredible.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/67013982"},

Buoyed by an early breakthrough, there was disappointment in conceding a cheap equaliser. On top for large parts of the second half, elation was quickly followed by deflation when the video assistant referee intervened to rule out what looked like a late winner. Then the cruellest of twists. Possession conceded near the edge of the box in the fifth of six minutes added on and, as sudden as a Glasgow downpour, the visitors had the ball in the net. Dumbfounded dismay. And finally, stubborn defiance. \"We still believe,\" right-back Alistair Johnston said. \"Our minds are still on getting out of this group.\" It looked like Brendan Rodgers' side were on their way to a frustrating point, only to be hit by the latest of sucker-punches. Now they prop up Group E with nothing to show from two outings.  Next up is a double-header with Atletico Madrid. The Spaniards have been in two Champions League finals since Celtic last celebrated a home win in the tournament. By the time Diego Simeone's star-studded squad show up at Celtic Park in three weeks' time, a 2-1 win over Ajax will be from a decade ago. \"We need to really dig in and find a way to get some points on the board against Atletico,\" added Johnston. \"We lose again and the ride is probably done.\" Captain Callum McGregor echoed those thoughts, saying: \"The next game is massive now. \"We have to learn quickly. I've said it before, but it's about concentration at this level. \"There's nothing in this group that should scare us. The performance levels have been really good in large spells of both games. \"Tonight we were the team in the ascendancy. With 20 minutes to go, it looks like only we are going to win the game. That makes it sore, that you've done enough to probably win the game, never mind getting a draw.\" By the lofty standards of this rarefied competition it appears damaging. Yes, Lazio qualified as Serie A runners-up and boast a squad full of internationals, but they are the pot three team and form has been shaky this season, with only four teams worse off in the league after seven matches. This was only a second Champions League away win in 17 attempts for the team from Rome. \"This was a chance, Feyenoord was a missed opportunity as well, but this is a huge one,\" former Scotland forward James McFadden said on BBC Sportsound. \"Lazio looked like a team holding on for a draw. There are so many positives for Celtic to take, but how often can you say it?\" Rodgers had said he wanted his team to \"start in fifth gear\" and they duly obliged, with his forwards a blur of pressing motion. Lazio were cut open by a slick passing move and Kyogo Furuhashi was celebrating his first Champions League goal after 12 minutes. Celtic tried to keep their foot on the accelerator, but a lapse at a corner allowed Matias Vecino to level. The hosts were the more menacing side after the interval and only the slightest touch from Daizen Maeda meant a Luis Palma strike was offside. Substitute Cameron Carter-Vickers, given a hero's reception on his return from injury, was guilty of losing the ball moments before Pedro's decisive header. \"I don't think Celtic are that far away, but you cannot play well for 93 minutes and switch off for two,\" was the assessment of the club's former winger, Aiden McGeady. Johnston, unhappy with his own role in the game's last throes, added: \"You've got to find that balance when you're pushing for the winner and feel like you're on top and not leaving yourself vulnerable at the back. \"We all signed for this club to play in these kind of matches.

{"title": "Celtic 2-2 Atletico Madrid: Diego Simeone at centre of Champions League anarchy", "content": "Diego Simeone scrunched his nose, gave a nonchalant shrug of his shoulders, and waved a comforting hand in the face of the anarchy raining down around him. It was a small gesture in a big moment. His Atletico Madrid team had just conceded a startlingly early Champions League goal at Celtic Park, but the man in the big padded jacket on the touchline seemed unperturbed.  As an exhausting first half unravelled in front of his eyes, the Argentine's downward spiral was almost as lively as the absorbing contest in front of his, at times, exasperated face.  This ground on these nights does strange things to people, albeit not recently. Eleven years have gone by since Barcelona, arguably the greatest ensemble of footballers in modern times, were humbled in the east end of Glasgow.  Thirteen minutes after Kyogo Furuhashi's opener, Nahuel Molina's panicked clearance into the stand was met with a two-handed signal from Simeone appealing for calm.  An Atletico corner, which within 15 seconds was being desperately defended at the other end of the pitch, triggered a similar response as the Spaniards toiled. Even in the relief of Antoine Griezmann turning in the rebound from his own saved penalty, Simeone's earlier shouts for composure continued. Luis Palma's shot brought Celtic Park to its feet. The Atletico coach muttered to himself frantically, while 15 yards to his left Brendan Rodgers punched the Glasgow sky.  By the time the clock hit half an hour, the jacket had been ditched. You half expected Simeone to be down to his bare chest by the break.  A Matt O'Riley shot arrowed at Jan Oblak brought Simeone to a crouch with his gasp hidden behind his hands, while Axel Witsel's disallowed goal just before the break was met with a desperate glance to his bench for a VAR intervention. While Simeone had a tough first 45 minutes, spare a thought for his left-back.  Javier Galan was making his first start of the season, and it only lasted until the interval. He was culpable for both Celtic goals, firstly for not following Kyogo, then standing off Palma. He also repeatedly gave Daizen Maeda encouragement to stretch his legs.    Simeone's team switched from flummoxed to phenomenal at the flick of a switch at times, mostly at the feet of Griezmann.  But it was Alvaro Morata who would level with a header that brought about such celebration from his coach that the Argentine spent the next minute hobbling about his technical area.  Atletico came into this one on the back of six straight victories, but there would not be one coming to give Simeone something positive to get worked up over.  Despite his gesturing, frantic pacing, waving and appealing for composure from his lot, their attacking momentum effectively ended when Rodrigo de Paul picked up a daft second booking.  Simeone's response? Manic gesticulating towards the dark Glasgow sky. There were no answers coming back.  His team's race had been run, a late chance for a breakaway from Griezmann instead being held up at half way telling its own story.

{"title": "Young Boys 1-3 Man City: Erling Haaland double seals victory in Switzerland", "content": "573 Manchester City maintained their perfect Champions League record with a hard-fought win at Young Boys. Erling Haaland scored twice in the second half, his first Champions League goals in six games, first with a penalty, then a fine curling effort. Reigning champions City had dominated proceedings and led in the 48th minute when Manuel Akanji tapped in. The Swiss hosts pulled level shortly after through Meschack Elia's exquisite chip. But Haaland's 67th-minute penalty, followed by his second with four minutes remaining, ensured City remain top of Group G with nine points from three games. \"That is how it goes, if you don't take them chances it can be difficult,\" City defender Rico Lewis told TNT Sports. \"In the end the forwards took their chances and we won the game.\" Pep Guardiola's side are now unbeaten in their past 16 Champions League matches, winning 10 and drawing six, with only Manchester United between 2007 and 2009 ever having a longer run without defeat among English teams in the competition. They led when Switzerland defender Akanji netted in his homeland from close range after Ruben Dias' header was palmed on to the crossbar by Young Boys keeper Anthony Racioppi. City were pegged back in style when Elia was set free with a direct through ball to perfectly lob the stranded Ederson. But Rodri was caught on the ankle by a clumsy Mohamed Ali Camara lunge in the box, which allowed Haaland to slam home from the spot and seal all three points in Bern - before he added gloss to the scoreline. For the holders, this game was about getting out of Wankdorf Stadium with their 100% group record intact and injury free, with the Manchester derby at Old Trafford in four days' time. Concerns were raised about the artificial pitch, which was criticised by Guardiola in his pre-match media conference and in his TV interview afterwards. \"On this pitch it is more difficult, the ball comes in a different shape,\" he told TNT Sports. \"But the way we played positionally was really good.\" It was thought the artificial turf could cause injuries and that it would take longer for players to recover fitness than if they played on grass. Torrential rain throughout this fixture did not help. \"It was a difficult game with the surface and the weather. The environment we are in Young Boys are used to,\" said Lewis. \"We played well in the first half and it was a bit back and forth in the second half, but we got the job done.\" City clearly wanted the game won early and soon settled into possession-heavy domination, but in the first half their finishing was as questionable as the cardigan-and-jeans combination in which the players arrived for the match. Haaland cut a frustrated figure at times as City were made to work hard for this win against a disciplined Young Boys side. The Swiss champions have a history of upsetting Manchester teams - their most recent home against Premier League opposition saw them beat United 2-1 in the 2021-22 Champions League - and they were comfortable inviting the City pressure, playing on the counter-attack. They refused to be cowed when City broke through, only for Haaland to intervene and snatch all three points. Now all eyes turn to Sunday. Guardiola made six changes to his starting XI from Saturday's  2-1 Premier League win over Brighton , including the return of Jack Grealish. The midfielder has struggled for game time since recovering from a dead leg last month, being named on the bench for the past four fixtures, but was backed by his manager who pre-match said he did not \"have a piece of doubt about Jack\". The England international nearly helped put City ahead twice in the first half, first finding Jeremy Doku in space in the area, but the Belgian fired straight at the goalkeeper. Then Grealish's curling shot on 34 minutes was dropped by Racioppi, allowing Matheus Nunes to bundle the ball towards goal before Loris Benito cleared off the goalline.  Grealish faded in the second half, and inadvertently denied City a goal when he miscontrolled the ball on to his arm before playing in Julian Alvarez whose calm finish was disallowed by VAR.
